        "abstract":"Difelikefalin is to date the first and only specific treatment to be approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in adult patients on hemodialysis. This was a retrospective, single-center, real-life study in hemodialysis patients with CKD-aP treated with difelikefalin. The primary objective was to evaluate the evolution of the intensity of pruritus during treatment with difelikefalin using the Worst Itch Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS). Adult patients were included if they had been on hemodialysis for at least 3 months and were suffering from moderate to severe CKD-aP (objectified by the WI-NRS score) for which difelikefalin had been prescribed. 11 patients (7 men and 4 women; mean age, 63.8 years) with a mean (SD) weekly dialysis time of 13 h (2.4) were included. The mean hemodialysis duration was 5 (3.6) years and the mean pruritus duration was 4.3 (3.2) years. At inclusion, on-going treatments of CKD-aP were emollients in all patients and antihistamines in 9 patients. The mean WI-NRS score was 7.4 (1.1) at initiation of difelikefalin. At last assessment after a median follow-up of 9.0 months, the mean change of WI-NRS score was -5.1 (2.9) and 82% of patients had a decrease ≥ 3 points. Mild to moderate adverse reactions to difelikefalin were reported in 4 patients, all of whom recovered without sequelae. These results show that difelikefalin, prescribed according to its therapeutic indication, is effective in the treatment of CKD-aP under real-life conditions, outside the controlled conditions of a clinical trial. La difélikéfaline est à ce jour le premier et le seul traitement spécifique approuvé pour le traitement du prurit d’intensité modérée à sévère associé à la maladie rénale chronique (Pa-MRC) chez les patients adultes hémodialysés. Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective, monocentrique, en vie réelle, chez des patients hémodialysés souffrant de Pa-MRC et traités par difélikéfaline. L’objectif principal était d’évaluer l’évolution de l’intensité du prurit au cours du suivi à l’aide de l’échelle WI-NRS (Worst Itch Intensity-Numerical Rating Scale). Les patients adultes ont été inclus s’ils étaient hémodialysés depuis au moins trois mois et souffraient d’un Pa-MRC modéré à sévère (objectivé par le score WI-NRS) pour lequel la difélikéfaline avait été prescrite. Onze patients (7 hommes et 4 femmes ; âge moyen : 63,8 ans) avec un temps de dialyse hebdomadaire moyen (SD) de 13 heures (2,4) ont été inclus. La durée moyenne d’hémodialyse était de 5 ans (3,6) et la durée moyenne de prurit de 4,3 ans (3,2). À l’inclusion, les traitements du prurit en cours étaient des émollients pour tous les patients et des antihistaminiques pour 9 d’entre eux. Le score WI-NRS moyen était de 7,4 (1,1) au début du traitement par la difélikéfaline. À la dernière évaluation, après un suivi médian de 9 mois, la variation moyenne du score WI-NRS était de -5,1 (2,9) et 82 % des patients avaient une diminution ≥ 3 points. Des effets indésirables d’intensité légère à modérée liés à la difélikéfaline ont été rapportés chez 4 patients, tous rétablis sans séquelles. Ces résultats montrent que la difélikéfaline, prescrite conformément à son indication thérapeutique, est efficace en vie réelle dans le traitement du Pa-MRC, en dehors des conditions contrôlées d’un essai clinique.",

        "abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common and severe complication in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). While inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system remained for a long time the only medications that had proven nephroprotective effects, several other pharmacological classes also recently showed such a benefit : sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (gliflozins), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA, finerenone). This clinical vignette aims at explaining the pharmacotherapy strategy for a patient with T2D who presents a progressive CKD.

Its use varies from country to country. In France, only 11% of CKD5 patients are treated with PD, with great disparity between regions, the majority being supported with center hemodialysis (HD). Yet this treatment offers many advantages. It is a home-based treatment, allowing greater autonomy, and easy for patients to learn. In the event of incapacity, assistance can be provided by a nurse or a relative. No vascular approach is required. Its effectiveness in terms of patient survival is at least identical to that of HD patients. It is vital that all patients at MRC4 or 5 stage should be managed within the care pathway recommended by Haute Autorité de santé, so that they can benefit, among other things, from informed pre-dialysis information on the different dialysis modalities.

        "abstract":"Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but remains under-diagnosed and its prognosis poorly documented in the absence of anemia. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between ID and the risk of major adverse outcomes in patients with CKD. Using data from the French Chronic Kidney Disease - Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN) cohort which included and followed over five years, 3,033 patients with CKD stages 2 to 5 CKD, we estimated the prevalence of ID, defined by a ferritin level < 100 μg\/L and\/or a transferrin saturation < 20%, and associated hazard ratios (HR) of kidney failure with replacement therapy, kidney failure defined by an eGFR < 15 mL\/min per 1.73 m2 or initiation of kidney replacement therapy, all-cause mortality, and death or hospitalization for heart failure. Baseline prevalence of ID in the cohort (66% men; mean age 67 ± 13 years) was 50% (48-52). Mean hemoglobin was 13 ± 1.7 g\/dL, and only 31% of patients with ID also had a hemoglobin < 12 g\/dL. In 2,803 patients with CKD stages 2-4 at baseline, ID was associated with significant increased risk of kidney failure, and of kidney failure with replacement therapy, with HRs adjusted for confounders and hemoglobin level of 1.22 (1.03-1.45) and 1.57 (1.27-1.94), respectively. Adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality and hospitalization or death for heart failure, were 1.31 (1.04-1.66) and 1.38 (1.07-1.80), respectively. This study shows that ID is significantly associated with the risk for kidney failure, all-cause mortality, and heart failure, independent of the presence of anemia. La carence martiale (CM) est fréquente chez les patients atteints de maladie rénale chronique (MRC), mais reste sous-diagnostiquée et son pronostic mal documenté en l’absence d’anémie. L’étude visait à évaluer la relation entre la CM et le risque d’événements majeurs chez les patients atteints de MRC. Dans la cohorte française Chronic Kidney Disease – Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD-REIN), qui a inclus et suivi pendant cinq ans 3 033 patients atteints de MRC de stades 2 à 5, nous avons estimé la prévalence de la CM, définie par un taux de ferritinémie < 100 μg\/L et\/ou un coefficient de saturation de la transferrine < 20 %, et les hazard ratios (HR) associés de défaillance rénale avec traitement de suppléance, de défaillance rénale définie par un eGFR < 15 mL\/min pour 1,73 m2 ou l’initiation d’un traitement de suppléance, de mortalité et d’insuffisance cardiaque. La prévalence de la CM à l’inclusion dans la cohorte (66 % d’hommes ; âge moyen 67 ± 13 ans) était de 50 % (48-52). Le taux moyen d’hémoglobine était de 13 ± 1,7 g\/dL et seuls 31 % des patients avec une CM avaient une hémoglobine < 12 g\/dL. Chez les 2 803 patients avec une MRC stades 2-4 à l’inclusion, la CM était associée à une augmentation significative du risque de défaillance rénale et de défaillance rénale avec traitement de suppléance, avec des HR ajustés sur les facteurs de confusion et le taux d’hémoglobine respectivement de 1,22 (1,03-1,45) et 1,57 (1,27-1,94). Les HR ajustés de mortalité toutes causes, et d’hospitalisation ou de décès pour une insuffisance cardiaque liés à la CM étaient respectivement de 1,31 (1,04-1,66), et 1,38 (1,07-1,80).

        "abstract":"In Canada, regional evaluations of screening practices for chronic kidney disease (CKD) among people with diabetes highlight areas for improvement; however, national estimates are notably absent. Estimates of CKD incidence often discount the expected decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) associated with age; age-adaptive thresholds may help account for this. We describe the frequency of screening and diagnosis of CKD among adults with diabetes from a nationally representative primary care cohort. In this retrospective cohort study, we used electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. We followed adult patients (≥18 years of age) with diabetes without CKD at baseline for 5 years starting in 2014. We determined the frequency of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACr) and\/or eGFR testing over time. We identified incident CKD diagnoses based on eGFR measurements using fixed-threshold and age-adaptive definitions and quantified the incidence proportion and rate. We analyzed records from 37,604 patients with diabetes. Only 13% of patients had yearly eGFR and uACr testing for CKD, although roughly 60% had non-yearly use of both tests in 5 years. eGFR testing was performed more frequently than uACr testing (94.1% vs 76.6% having testing over follow-up). We found increased incidence proportions (14.6% vs 6.0%) and rates (33.1 vs 13.4 diagnoses per 1,000 person-years) of CKD using the fixed-threshold compared with age-adaptive definition. Our study presents the first national understanding of screening practices for CKD among people with diabetes in Canada. Specifically, increased use of uACr testing should be encouraged for early detection of changes in kidney function.",

Those prevalence rates were two to four times higher than in mainland France which is consistent with the high prevalence rate of end stage renal disease treated in New Caledonia. Hence, CKD prevention is essential for New Caledonia. La Nouvelle-Calédonie est une collectivité française dans l’océan Pacifique Sud. Le taux de prévalence de l’insuffisance rénale chronique terminale traitée s’élève à près de 3 000 par million d’habitants, soit un des taux de prévalence parmi les plus élevés au monde. Cet article présente pour la première fois les taux de prévalence de la maladie rénale chronique aux stades 3-5 pour la Nouvelle-Calédonie, définie par un débit de filtration glomérulaire estimé inférieur à 60 mL\/min\/1,73 m2. Ces résultats ont été estimés à partir des deux enquêtes « Baromètre santé adulte » en population générale adulte. Notre étude a estimé des taux de prévalence de 7,8 % [6,1 ; 10,1] et de 5,3 % [3,3 ; 8,5]. Le taux de prévalence de la maladie rénale chronique serait donc deux à quatre fois plus élevé qu’en France métropolitaine. La prévention de la maladie rénale chronique est primordiale pour la Nouvelle-Calédonie.",

        "abstract":"Preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health objective. CKD leads to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with a negative impact on quality of life and significant societal repercussions. Several drugs are effective in preventing and curbing CKD, including blockers of the renin\/angiotensin\/aldosterone system and inhibitors of the SGLT2 co-transporter. New molecules are currently in clinical trials focusing on the nephro-protection, such as non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and GPL-1 receptor agonists. In addition to this drug arsenal, CKD prevention also relies on non-pharmacological optimization of hygienic-dietary measures, including smoking avoidance, physical activity and dietetics. The aim of this article is to detail this non-medicinal approach to the prevention and slow down of CKD. La prévention de la maladie rénale chronique (MRC) est un objectif majeur de santé publique. La MRC engendre, en effet, une morbi-mortalité cardiovasculaire importante, avec un impact négatif sur la qualité de vie et des répercussions sociétales non négligeables. Plusieurs piliers médicamenteux sont efficaces dans la prévention et la freination de la MRC, tels que les bloqueurs du système rénine\/angiotensine\/aldostérone et les inhibiteurs du co-transporteur SGLT2. De nouvelles molécules sont en cours d’essais cliniques visant la néphro-protection, comme les antagonistes non stéroïdiens du récepteur aux minéralocorticoïdes et les agonistes du récepteur au GPL-1. Outre cet arsenal médicamenteux, la prévention de la MRC repose également sur une optimisation non pharmacologique des mesures hygiéno-diététiques, comprenant l’éviction tabagique, l’activité physique et la diététique. L’objectif de cet article est de détailler cette approche non médicamenteuse dans la prévention et la freination de la MRC.",

        "abstract":"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is a disabling symptom which is frequent and often underestimated. Pa-MRC has a negative impact on quality of life, and is frequently accompanied by sleep disorders and depression. The approval of difelikefalin – a kappa opioid receptor agonist – in this indication requires updated recommendations. As a first step, secondary causes of pruritus without skin lesions must be ruled out, and general measures taken (emollients, psychological support, optimization of dialysis, normalization of serum calcium, phosphate and PTH in the range proposed by the KGIDO guidelines, treatment of iron deficiency). A therapeutic test with a non-sedating oral antihistamine may be proposed. If this test is negative, Pa-MRC must be strongly suspected, and its intensity (WI-NRS scale) and impact on quality of life assessed. In the case of mild Pa-MRC (WI-NRS ≤ 3), only general measures are implemented. If Pa-MRC is moderate to severe (WI-NRS ≥ 4), specific treatment with difelikefaline can be initiated for 6 months in addition to general measures. At 3 months, if the response is complete (WI-NRS score ≤ 1) or partial (decline ≥ 3 points), treatment is continued. At 6 months, if the response is complete, treatment may be discontinued with the patient’s agreement; treatment is maintained if the response is partial. At 3 or 6 months, if response is insufficient (decline < 3 points) and\/or in the event of intolerance, treatment is discontinued and an alternative treatment (e.g., gabapentinoids, UVB) may be considered after dermatological consultation. Le prurit associé à la maladie rénale chronique (Pa-MRC) est un symptôme invalidant qui est fréquent et souvent sous-estimé. Le Pa-MRC a des conséquences négatives sur la qualité de vie et s’accompagne fréquemment de troubles du sommeil et de dépression. L’approbation de la difélikéfaline – agoniste des récepteurs opioïdes kappa – dans cette indication nécessite l’actualisation des recommandations. Les causes secondaires de prurit sans lésions cutanées doivent être exclues et des mesures générales doivent être prises (émollients, aide psychologique, optimisation de la dialyse, équilibre phosphocalcique avec parathormone [PTH] dans la cible KDIGO [Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes], traitement de la carence martiale). Une épreuve thérapeutique avec un antihistaminique oral non sédatif peut être proposée.

        "abstract":"Adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome have only been evaluated retrospectively using heterogeneous methods and with contradictory results. We aimed to describe adverse pregnancy, delivery, and birth outcome risks in pregnant women with primary Sjögren's syndrome compared with those of a matched general population in France, and to identify factors predictive of disease flares or adverse pregnancy outcomes. We conducted a multicentre, prospective, cohort study in France using the GR2 (Groupe de Recherche sur la Grossesse et les Maladies Rares) registry. Women from the GR2 study were eligible if they had conceived before March, 2021, had primary Sjögren's syndrome according to the American College of Rheumatology and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) 2016 classification criteria, and had an ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation. In women who entered in the registry with pregnancies before 18 weeks of gestation, we sought to identify factors associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome flare (≥3-point increase in EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index [ESSDAI] score) or adverse pregnancy outcomes (fetal or neonatal death, placental insufficiency leading to a preterm delivery [<37 weeks of gestation], or small-for-gestational-age birthweight). A matched controlled study compared adverse pregnancy, delivery, and birth outcome rates between pregnant women with primary Sjögren's syndrome from the GR2 registry and matched controls from the general population included in the last French perinatal survey (Enquête Nationale Périnatale 2016). 1944 pregnancies were identified in the GR2 cohort, of which 106 pregnancies in 96 women with primary Sjögren's syndrome were included in this analysis. The median age at pregnancy onset was 33 years (IQR 31-36). 87 (83%) of 105 pregnancies (with ethnicity data) were in White women, 18 (17%) were in Black women; 92 (90%) of 102 had previous systemic activity (ESSDAI score of ≥1; data missing in four pregnancies), and 48 (45%) of 106 had systemic activity at inclusion. Of 93 pregnancies included at week 18 of gestation or earlier, primary Sjögren's syndrome flares occurred in 12 (13%). No baseline parameters were associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome flare. Four twin pregnancies and one medical termination were excluded from the adverse pregnancy outcome analysis; of the remaining 88, adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in six (7%). Among pregnancies in women with data for antiphospholipid antibodies (n=55), antiphospholipid antibody positivity was more frequent among pregnancies with adverse outcomes (two [50%] of four pregnancies) compared with those without adverse outcomes (two [4%] of 51 pregnancies; p=0·023). Anti-RNP antibody positivity was also more frequent among pregnancies with adverse outcomes than those without, although this was not statistically significant. In the matched controlled study, adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in nine (9%) of 105 pregnancies in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome and 28 (7%) of the 420 matched control pregnancies; adverse pregnancy outcomes were not significantly associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (odds ratio 1·31, 95% CI 0·53-2·98; p=0·52). Pregnancies in women with primary Sjögren's syndrome had very good prognoses for mothers and fetuses, with no overall increase in adverse pregnancy outcome risk compared with the general population. Women with antiphospholipid antibodies or anti-RNP antibodies require close monitoring, because these factors might be associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

In a subsequent analysis that combined these two clinical trials (FIDELITY), the reduction becomes statistically significant when compared to placebo for both outcomes, with a hazard ratio of 0.86 (95 % confidence interval 0.78-0.95; P = 0.0018) for the cardiovascular outcome and 0.77 (0.67-0.88; P = 0.0002) for the renal outcome. Furthermore, all renal events occurred less frequently with finerenone than with placebo, including the progression to end-stage CKD independently of the baseline levels of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria and regardless of associated medications (including gliflozins). The safety profile was excellent. However, a significant increase in serum potassium level was observed. Even if it is less pronounced than the increase usually seen with spironolactone, the risk of hyperkalemia requires some caution regarding both patient selection and monitoring. Finerenone (Kerendia®) is indicated in the treatment of CKD with albuminuria in adult patients with T2D. In Belgium, it is reimbursed with conditions in combination with a renin-angiotensin blocker. La finérénone, un nouvel antagoniste non stéroïdien du récepteur des minéralocorticoïdes, a montré, dans deux grandes études réalisées chez des patients avec un diabète de type 2 (DT2) et une maladie rénale chronique (MRC), une réduction significative du critère composite rénal dans FIDELIO-DKD et du critère composite cardiovasculaire dans FIGARO-DKD. Dans une analyse combinant les deux études (FIDELITY), la réduction est statistiquement significative dans le groupe finérénone par rapport au groupe placebo pour les deux critères, avec un hasard ratio de 0,86 (intervalle de confiance à 95 % 0,78-0,95; P = 0,0018) pour le critère cardiovasculaire et de 0,77 (0,67-0,88; P = 0,0002) pour le critère rénal. De plus, tous les événements rénaux surviennent moins fréquemment sous finérénone que sous placebo, y compris la progression vers l’insuffisance rénale terminale et ce, indépendamment du niveau du débit de filtration glomérulaire et de l’albuminurie à l’inclusion dans les essais ou des traitements associés (y compris les gliflozines). Le profil de sécurité est excellent, avec cependant une élévation de la kaliémie. Si elle est moindre que celle observée avec la spironolactone, elle nécessite néanmoins des précautions d’usage en termes de sélection des patients et de leur surveillance. La finérénone (Kerendia®) est indiquée dans le traitement de la MRC avec albuminurie chez le patient adulte avec DT2 et est remboursée en Belgique, sous conditions, en association avec un bloqueur du système rénine-angiotensine.",

        "abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cognitive disorders, presenting as vascular dementia, compared with the general population. These cognitive disorders occur early during the course of the kidney disease and evolve in parallel with the decline in glomerular filtration rate. They affect 30 to 80 % of patients with stage 5 CKD. Kidney transplantation only partially improves cognitive impairment. In this narrative review, we summarize the epidemiology and recent clinical and experimental data on cognitive impairment in CKD and discuss the potential specific mechanisms. Among the factors associated with cognitive impairment, the accumulation of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate appears to be a specific risk factor for cognitive decline. These toxins have an endothelial toxicity that can disrupt the cerebral endothelium. The rupture of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a mechanism implicated in several neurodegenerative pathologies and systemic diseases with cerebral tropism. Recent experimental findings in CKD indicate that disruption of the BBB appears to be an important mechanism behind cognitive impairment in CKD. In murine models of CKD, increased BBB permeability is linked to memory impairment and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation following accumulation of circulating indoxyl sulfate. This disruption of the BBB could also have harmful consequences for stroke susceptibility and drug neurotoxicity in CKD patients. Les patients atteints de maladie rénale chronique (MRC) présentent un risque accru de troubles neurocognitifs par rapport à la population générale, se présentant sous la forme d’une démence vasculaire. Ces troubles cognitifs interviennent précocement dans la maladie rénale et évoluent en parallèle au déclin du débit de filtration glomérulaire. Ils concernent 30 à 80 % des patients au stade 5 de la MRC. La transplantation rénale n’améliore que partiellement les troubles cognitifs. Dans cette revue narrative, nous résumons l’épidémiologie et les données cliniques et expérimentales récentes sur les troubles cognitifs dans la MRC, et nous en abordons les mécanismes spécifiques potentiels. Parmi les facteurs associés aux atteintes cognitives, l’accumulation des toxines urémiques, comme l’indoxyl sulfate, apparaît comme un facteur de risque spécifique de déclin cognitif. Ces toxines possèdent une toxicité endothéliale pouvant perturber l’endothélium cérébral. La rupture de la barrière hémato-encéphalique (BHE) est un mécanisme impliqué dans plusieurs pathologies neuro-dégénératives et des maladies systémiques à tropisme cérébral. Les résultats de travaux expérimentaux récents dans la MRC indiquent que la rupture de la BHE semble être un mécanisme important des troubles cognitifs au cours de la MRC. Dans les modèles murins de MRC, la perméabilité accrue de la BHE est liée à l’atteinte de la mémoire et à l’activation d’Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor suite à l’accumulation d’indoxyl sufate circulant. Cette rupture de la BHE pourrait également avoir des conséquences néfastes sur la susceptibilité aux accidents vasculaires cérébraux (AVC) et à la neurotoxicité médicamenteuse chez les patients MRC.",

        "abstract":"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is common in hemodialysis patients and severely impairs their quality of life, but the practices of nephrologists remain poorly known. The objective of this on-line survey was to describe the management of CKD-aP in French nephrologists affiliated with the French-speaking Society of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation (SFNDT) and involved in hemodialysis. In total, 122 questionnaires were completed and 100 were usable. Nephrologists reported they personally managed a median of 52 patients; they estimated that the CKD-aP prevalence in their hemodialysis patients was a median of 10% (IQR, 6.3-17.2); 6% of nephrologists reported not following any patient with CKD-aP. In case of CKD-aP, the first-intention intervention was the evaluation of phosphocalcic metabolism (53.5%) and verification of dialysis adequacy (52%). For moderate-to-severe CKD-aP, the first-line prescription was topical therapy (71.3%), antihistamine (23.2%) and membrane change (15.9%). Patients were referred to a dermatologist mainly in case of treatment failure (86.9%) or scratching lesions (40.4%). Available treatments were considered ineffective for 50.5% of nephrologists, partially effective for 45.5% and effective for only 4%. These results show that according to the opinion of nephrologists, the pruritus prevalence is low in dialysis patients. This is inconsistent with studies based on systematic patient interviews, thus suggesting that pruritus is a symptom overlooked by nephrologists. In the context of the arrival of a new drug for pruritus, patients should be more questioned about this symptom in order to propose this treatment. Le prurit associé à l’insuffisance rénale chronique (Pa-IRC) est fréquent chez les patients hémodialysés et altère gravement leur qualité de vie, mais les pratiques des néphrologues restent mal connues. L’objectif de cette enquête en ligne était de décrire la prise en charge du Pa-IRC par les néphrologues français hémodialyseurs affiliés à la Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation (SFNDT). Au total, 122 questionnaires ont été remplis et 100 étaient utilisables. Les néphrologues suivaient personnellement 52 patients (médiane). Ils estimaient que la prévalence du Pa-IRC chez ces patients était de 10 % (médiane ; écart interquartile : 6,3-17,2) ; 6 % des néphrologues ont déclaré ne suivre aucun patient atteint de Pa-IRC. En cas de Pa-IRC, l’intervention de première intention était l’évaluation du métabolisme phosphocalcique (53,5 %) et la vérification de la qualité de dialyse (52 %). Pour le Pa-IRC modéré à sévère, la prescription de première intention était un traitement topique (71,3 %), un antihistaminique (23,2 %) et un changement de membrane (15,9 %). Les traitements disponibles étaient considérés comme inefficaces pour 50,5 % des néphrologues, partiellement efficaces pour 45,5 % et efficaces pour seulement 4 %. Ces résultats montrent que selon l’opinion des néphrologues, la prévalence du prurit est faible chez les patients dialysés. Ceci est en contradiction avec les études basées sur des entretiens systématiques avec les patients, suggérant ainsi que le prurit est un symptôme sous-estimé par les néphrologues. Dans le contexte de l’arrivée d’un nouveau médicament pour le prurit, les patients devraient être davantage interrogés sur ce symptôme afin de proposer ce traitement.",

The main objective of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of constipation in CKD patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter data-driven study. 74 patient records were analyzed. We found a prevalence of constipation of 58&#160;% in patients with CKD. Our results showed that the prevalence of constipation is frequent in patients with CKD. It leads to a significant discomfort for the patient, an additional cost in terms of care and technical procedures and a failure of the peritoneal dialysis technique. Thus, the prevention of constipation in CKD patients would be relevant to limit complications and ensure a better quality of life. En 1989, des experts ont mis au point la classification des critères de Rome couplée à l’utilisation de l’échelle de Bristol, afin d’objectiver l’état de constipation fonctionnelle. Aujourd’hui, la littérature documente peu les troubles du transit des patients en Insuffisance rénale chronique terminale (IRCT) traités par la Dialyse péritonéale (DP), alors même que cela engendre des complications non négligeables sur la morbidité, le confort et la qualité de vie du patient. L’objectif principal de notre étude était d’évaluer la prévalence de la constipation des patients en IRCT. Nous avons réalisé une étude rétrospective multicentrique sur données. 74 dossiers patients ont été analysés. Nous avons mis en évidence une prévalence de la constipation de 58 % chez des patients atteints d’une IRCT. Nos résultats ont démontré que la prévalence de la constipation est fréquente chez les patients atteints d’une IRCT. Elle entraîne un inconfort notable chez le patient, un surcoût au niveau des soins et des actes techniques, et un échec de la technique de dialyse péritonéale. Ainsi, la prévention de la constipation des patients en IRCT serait pertinente pour limiter les complications et leur assurer une meilleure qualité de vie.",

On the issue of survival of ESKD patients, the following key messages were retained. The annual mortality rates of ESKD patients are relatively stable even though patients are ageing and increasingly have diabetes or obesity. These changes are probably linked to improved practices. Cardiovascular diseases and infections are the main causes of death. The year 2020 was marked by an increase in mortality due to the SARS-CoV-19 infection that was particularly severe in these patients. À l’occasion des 20 ans du REIN (Réseau Epidémiologie et Information en Néphrologie), un travail de synthèse sur les apports du registre a été mené. Sur la question de la survie des patients avec une maladie rénale stade 5, les messages clés suivants ont été retenus. Les taux de mortalité annuels des patients en IRCT sont relativement stables alors même que les patients vieillissent et qu’ils sont de plus en plus souvent porteurs d’un diabète ou d’une obésité. Ces évolutions sont probablement en lien avec une amélioration des pratiques. Les maladies cardiovasculaires et les infections représentent les causes principales de décès.

        "abstract":"Kidney diseases encompass a variety of conditions, including chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. These diseases significantly impact patients' quality of life and health care costs, often necessitating substantial lifestyle changes, especially regarding dietary management. However, patients frequently receive ambiguous or conflicting dietary advice from health care providers, leading them to seek information and support from online health communities. This study aimed to analyze social media data to better understand the experiences, challenges, and concerns of patients with kidney disease and their caregivers in South Korea. Specifically, it explored how online communities assist in disease management and examined the sentiment surrounding dietary management. Data were collected from KidneyCafe, a prominent South Korean online community for patients with kidney disease hosted on the Naver platform. A total of 124,211 posts from 10 disease-specific boards were analyzed using latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling and Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers-based sentiment analysis. In addition, Efficiently Learning an Encoder That Classifies Token Replacements Accurately-based classification was used to further analyze posts related to disease management. The analysis identified 6 main topics within the community: family health and support, medication and side effects, examination and diagnosis, disease management, surgery for dialysis, and costs and insurance. Sentiment analysis revealed that posts related to the medication and side effects and surgery for dialysis topics predominantly expressed negative sentiments. Both significant negative sentiments concerning worries about kidney transplantation among family members and positive sentiments regarding physical improvements after transplantation were expressed in posts about family health and support. For disease management, 7 key subtopics were identified, with inquiries about dietary management being the leading subtopic. The findings highlight the critical role of online communities in providing support and information for patients with kidney disease and their caregivers. The insights gained from this study can inform health care providers, policy makers, and support organizations to better address the needs of patients with kidney disease, particularly in areas related to dietary management and emotional support.",

However, its prognostic role in patients undergoing complex high-risk PCI (CHIP) remains unexplored, prompting our investigation. Consecutive CHIP patients treated at a tertiary care center from 2012 to 2022 were included in the current analysis. CHIP was identified by the presence of at least one patient and one procedural criterion from a validated score. Patients were stratified by CKD status, with CKD defined as eGFR < 60 ml\/min\/1.73m Among 4855 CHIP patients, 39.6% (n = 1925) had CKD at baseline. CKD patients were older, with more comorbidities, and complex CAD. After multivariable adjustment, CKD was associated with increased 1-year risks of MACE (primarily driven by all-cause mortality and MI rates), and bleeding. In-hospital adjusted hazards for ischemic and bleeding events were similar between the two cohorts, while CA-AKI occurred twice as often in CKD patients compared to non-CKD ones. In CHIP patients, CKD is a strong predictor of ischemic and bleeding events at one-year follow-up and doubles the risk of post-procedural CA-AKI, underscoring the need for tailored risk assessment and management of this vulnerable population.",

In last years, several new therapeutic approaches for the management of people with diabetic and nondiabetic CKD and hypertension have been investigated. In this brief review, the most recent findings regarding the ability of SGLT-2 inhibitors and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA) and GLP-1 receptor agonists to prevent heart failure in patients with hypertension and CKD will be discussed. In the last 3 years, several large clinical trials involving very large numbers of CKD patients have been published showing that these new therapeutic approaches significantly reduce the risk of heart failure events and hospitalizations in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies and hypertension as well as in patients with heart failure without nephropathy. Moreover, these drugs retard the progression of CKD towards end-stage kidney disease. These observations already have a major impact on the management of people with hypertension and CKD. SGLT-2 inhibitors are now recommended as first-line therapy in people with diabetes, CKD and heart failure. The use of nsMRA is increasing and could replace spironolactone over time in heart failure as well as in early CKD stages.",

A retrospective single-center study was conducted using electronic health records from 640 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Clinical Centre in Gdansk, Poland, between November 2020 and May 2021. Patients were categorized based on disease severity into stable or ICU wards based on the disease severity. Data on demographics, comorbidities, complications, and treatments were collected and verified. Statistical analyses, including odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs), assessed mortality risk factors supported by python-based processing. The mean patient age was 67 years (SD ± 15.89), comprising 39% females (n = 250) and 60.94% males (n = 390). Mortality risk was highest in patients aged 65 years and older (OR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.97-4.60). Among the pre-existing comorbidities, chronic kidney disease (OR 3.28; 95% CI, 2.12-5.09), atrial fibrillation (OR 2.43; CI 95%, 1.63-3.61), and heart failure (OR 2.89; 95% CI, 1.91-4.37) were significant predictors of mortality. In hospital complications, such as severe respiratory failure requiring ICU ventilation (OR 23.59; 95% CI, 2.81-197.87), myocardial infarction (OR 25.43; 95% CI, 3.16-204.97), acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (OR 19.15; 95% CI, 6.49-56.51), sepsis (OR 7.22, 95% CI, 3.77-13.84), stroke, further increased mortality risk. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing renal and cardiovascular conditions face a higher risk of fatal outcomes. Early diagnosis and intervention targeting these complications are vital to in reducing mortality. Further research is needed to reconcile disparities with existing literature.",

ID in CKD can be classified as either absolute, resulting from blood loss, or functional, driven by inflammation and elevated hepcidin levels, which trap iron in macrophages and hepatocytes, preventing its use in erythropoiesis. Elevated hepcidin also reduces dietary iron absorption in the gut, making oral iron supplements ineffective, particularly in advanced CKD.

        "abstract":"Emerging evidence supports the beneficial effects of dietary fiber supplementation in alleviating gut dysbiosis, which leads to a reduction in uremic toxins and inflammatory markers in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, current evidence-based renal nutrition guidelines do not provide recommendations regarding dietary fiber intake. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate and highlight the effects of dietary fiber supplementation on modulating uremic toxins and inflammatory markers in individuals with CKD, with or without dialysis. The eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials until 27 November 2024. The results were synthesized using a random-effects model and presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 21 studies with 700 patients were included. When compared with the control group, dietary fiber supplementation ranging from 6 to 50 g\/day, for typically more than 4 weeks, could significantly reduce the levels of serum uremic toxins, including p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and blood urea nitrogen (SMD -0.22, -0.34, -0.25, respectively, with ",

The EMRs of 872 patients who underwent a carotid endarterectomy between 2009 and 2022 were analyzed with AI. This included 408 patients who had carotid intervention for symptomatic carotid disease and 464 patients for asymptomatic, >70% stenosis. By analyzing the EMRs, the Support Vector Machine achieved the highest sensitivity at 0.626 for predicting which of these patients would go on to develop a stroke or TIA. Random Forest had the highest specificity at 0.906. The risk for stroke in patients with carotid stenosis was a balance between optimum medical treatment and the underlying disease processes. Risk factors for developing symptomatic carotid disease included elevated glucose, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, and current or recent smoking, while protective factors included cardiovascular agents, antihypertensives, and beta blockers. An AI review of EMRs can help determine which patients with carotid stenosis are more likely to develop a stroke to assist with decision making as to whether to proceed with intervention or to demonstrate and encourage reduced stroke risk with risk factor modification.",

A cohort of 115 hemodialysis patients and 112 healthy controls completed the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the shorter MFIS-5, and the WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment. The findings indicate that hemodialysis patients experience significantly higher levels of fatigue, which correspond with lower quality of life, particularly in the physical and psychological domains, compared to healthy controls. Male patients reported significantly higher levels of fatigue and lower quality of life scores, whereas younger patients demonstrated relatively better outcomes. Extended dialysis sessions exceeding four hours were associated with poorer social well-being, and educational attainment was positively linked with physical and environmental quality of life domains. However, marital status did not show a significant effect. The study validates the consistency between MFIS and MFIS-5 scores, recommending MFIS-5 for time-sensitive clinical use without compromising accuracy. These results underscore the need for individualized, multi-dimensional approaches to fatigue management in hemodialysis patients, emphasizing interventions that address physical, psychological, and social well-being to enhance overall quality of life.

Beyond hematopoiesis, EPO influences non-hematopoietic tissues, including glucose and fat metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. EPO is used to treat anemia associated with chronic kidney disease clinically and plays a role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and regulating fat mass. EPO enhances lipolysis while inhibiting lipogenic gene expression in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver, acting through the EPO-EPOR-RUNX1 axis. The non-erythroid EPOR agonist ARA290 also improves diet-induced obesity and glucose tolerance providing evidence for EPO regulation of fat metabolism independent of EPO stimulated erythropoiesis.

We investigated the epidemiology and risk factors of renal insufficiency in patients with HF.

CKD was defined as the presence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m Right ventricular dysfunction was associated with CKD and WRF. In particular, echocardiographic parameters 'tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 15 mm' (P < 0.001; OR 2.932), 'tricuspid regurgitation (TR) > I°' [P < 0.001; odds ratio (OR) 5.958] and dilatation of inferior vena cava (IVC) (P < 0.001; OR 3.670) were significantly correlated with renal failure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly associated with CKD (P < 0.001; OR 6.109) and correlated with pressure and volume load of the right heart. The results of this work support the theory of right-sided cardiac backward failure, often accompanied by hypervolaemia, as a leading cause of HF-related renal failure.

Restricted cubic splines tested the association of eGFR with incident overall HF, and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF). Cox proportional hazards regression models evaluated the multivariable-adjusted association of eGFR categories with incident HF and its subtypes. The primary analysis included 23 309 women with 11 814 eGFR ≥90, 10 191 eGFR between 60 and 89, 1048 eGFR between 45 and 59 and 256 eGFR <45 mL\/min per 1.73 m Kidney dysfunction is associated with incident HF in postmenopausal women. Although lower eGFR is associated with both incident HFrEF and HFpEF, the association is stronger with HFpEF. URL: https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT00000611.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on transplant survival, cardiovascular events, dialysis, and all-cause mortality in diabetes patients who have undergone heart transplantation. In this research, we adopted data from the TriNetX collaborative network to observe outcomes in patients who underwent heart transplants between January 01, 2015 and December 31, 2022. A total of 6494 transplant recipients were identified, from which 1063 matched pairs of SGLT2i users and non-users were selected using propensity score matching. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare the risks of various outcomes between the study and control groups. In propensity-matched cohorts, patients using SGLT2i exhibited a lower risk of dialysis [hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.566 (0.385-0.833)], graft rejection and failure [0.873 (0.774-0.985)], hospitalizations [0.822 (0.739-0.916)], and all-cause death [0.767 (0.627-0.938)] compared to non-users. Yet, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in the risks of post-transplant infection or sepsis [0.891 (0.739-1.075)], ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.044, 95% CI: 0.939-1.161), and heart failure worsening [0.915 (0.733-1.144)]. This multicenter cohort study demonstrated that cardiac transplant recipients with diabetes who received SGLT2i had a significantly lower risk of dialysis, graft rejection, hospitalization, and all-cause mortality compared to those who did not receive SGLT2i.",

        "abstract":"A multitude of challenges exist when supporting older adults in deciding on the optimal kidney replacement therapy (KRT), including frailty, comorbidity, cognitive impairment, dialysis modality, as well as local availability of services. The combination of these factors can determine treatment outcomes and quality of life (QoL), and as such the care of older people should be tailored to take these into account. Frailty in older people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to higher rates of hospitalization, increased mortality, and a diminished QoL, while cognitive impairment, present in up to 50% of people with CKD, exacerbates these challenges and affects decision making. Dialysis, particularly haemodialysis, can accelerate physical and cognitive decline in frail older adults. Conversely, peritoneal dialysis (PD) presents a home-based alternative that may better support QoL, particularly for people wanting to prioritize treatment flexibility and independence. Assisted PD programmes have emerged as a valuable option for older people who cannot manage home-based care independently, improving access to KRT. Ultimately shared decision making should be employed when discussing KRT, incorporating patient goals, prognostic awareness, and QoL measures. There is also the emerging role of the geriatrician and the need for an integrated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. These elements support older adults to make informed choices that align with the individuals' values and health needs. In designing future health services to meet the needs of increasing numbers of older people, there needs to be increased access to assisted PD as well as multidisciplinary working to ensure patient-focused care surrounding KRT in older adults.",

This study aimed to assess changes in left atrial (LA) function in patients with CKD with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) and to investigate the independent correlations between baseline parameters and LA strain and strain rate. We conducted a prospective study that included patients diagnosed with CKD at Shenzhen People's Hospital between November 2020 and September 2021. Healthy participants were enrolled as a healthy control group. Conventional transthoracic echocardiography was performed to obtain conventional ultrasound parameters, with cines analyzed offline to determine strain and strain rate parameters. Single-factor analysis of variance was used to compare the groups. The relationship between different variables and LA strain and strain rate was analyzed by general linear regression. The relationship between left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and LA strain and strain rate was analyzed by multifactor linear regression. The study included 236 participants: 166 patients with CKD (85 in the CKD LA strain and strain rate are valuable indicators for detecting early LA functional changes in patients with CKD. LVMI independently negatively impacts all LA strain and strain rates and may be a predictor of cardiovascular events.",

Collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists is mandatory. The development of onconephrology is helping to improve knowledge and identify treatment pathways. The key elements of the diagnostic process are presented. The role of renal biopsy is discussed, as it appears to be underused in relation to the expected benefits. Renal biopsy allows ICI to be continued if AKI is not related to AKI. Treatment based on glucocorticoid therapy is recommended, with regimens depending on the severity of the disease and the renal response to glucocorticoid therapy. Alternative treatments for patients resistant to corticosteroids are discussed, but strong data are lacking.

        "abstract":"The extent to which postoperative hypotension contributes to renal injury remains unclear, much less what the harm thresholds might be. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that there is an absolute hypotensive arterial pressure threshold for acute kidney injury during the initial seven days after noncardiac surgery. We conducted a single-centre historical cohort analysis of adults who had noncardiac surgery and had creatinine recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. Our exposure was the lowest postoperative mean arterial pressure, defined as the average of the three lowest postoperative pressure measurements. Our primary analysis was the association between the lowest mean arterial pressure and acute kidney injury, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes initiative criteria. Our analysis was adjusted for potentially relevant confounding factors including intraoperative hypotension. Among 64,349 patients analyzed, 2,812 (4.4%) patients had postoperative acute kidney injury. Each 5-mm Hg decrease in the lowest mean arterial pressure was associated with a 28% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 23 to 32; P < 0.001) increase in the odds of acute kidney injury for lowest mean arterial pressures < 80 mm Hg. Higher lowest pressures were not associated with acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 1.08; 97.5% CI, 0.99 to 1.17; P = 0.04) for each 5-mm Hg decrease in the lowest mean arterial pressure. Postoperative hypotension, defined as the lowest postoperative mean arterial pressure < 80 mm Hg, was associated with acute kidney injury after noncardiac surgery. A prospective trial will be required to determine whether the observed association is causal and thus amenable to modification. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Nous ne savons pas dans quelle mesure l’hypotension postopératoire contribue aux lésions rénales, et nous connaissons encore moins les seuils de lésion. Nous avons donc testé l’hypothèse primaire selon laquelle il existerait un seuil absolu de tension artérielle hypotensive pour l’insuffisance rénale aiguë au cours des sept premiers jours suivant une chirurgie non cardiaque. MéTHODE: Nous avons mené une analyse de cohorte historique monocentrique auprès d’adultes ayant bénéficié d’une chirurgie non cardiaque et pour lesquel·les les taux de créatinine avant et après l’opération avaient été enregistrés. Notre exposition était la tension artérielle moyenne postopératoire la plus basse, définie comme la moyenne des trois mesures de tension postopératoire les plus basses. Notre analyse principale a porté sur l’association entre la tension artérielle moyenne la plus basse et l’insuffisance rénale aiguë, définies selon les critères de l’initiative KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes). Notre analyse a été ajustée pour tenir compte des facteurs de confusion potentiellement pertinents, notamment de l’hypotension peropératoire. RéSULTATS: Parmi les 64 349 patient·es analysé·es, 2812 (4,4 %) ont présenté une insuffisance rénale aiguë postopératoire. Chaque diminution de 5 mm Hg de la tension artérielle moyenne la plus faible était associée à une augmentation de 28 % (intervalle de confiance [IC] de 97,5 %, 23 à 32; P < 0,001) des risques d’insuffisance rénale aiguë pour les tensions artérielles moyennes les plus faibles < 80 mm Hg. Des tensions les plus faibles plus hautes n’ont pas été associées à une insuffisance rénale aiguë (rapport de cotes, 1,08; IC 97,5 %, 0,99 à 1,17; P = 0,04) pour chaque diminution de 5 mm Hg de la tension artérielle moyenne la plus faible. CONCLUSION: L’hypotension postopératoire, définie comme la tension artérielle moyenne postopératoire < 80 mm Hg la plus basse, a été associée à une insuffisance rénale aiguë après une chirurgie non cardiaque. Une étude prospective sera nécessaire pour déterminer si l’association observée est causale et donc susceptible d’être modifiée.",

The study assessed the difference in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over one year in non-dialysis renal failure patients between those who practiced exercise (P) and those who did not (NP).

Among the 259 patients included, 195 (75.3%) practiced a PA and 64 (24.7%) did not practiced. There was no significant difference in the slope of GFR decline from inclusion to month 12 between the two groups, p = 0.4107. Only the type of kidney seemed to be significantly associated with the slope of GFR decline over the 12 months (p = 0.0039). These results may be explained by a follow-up time too short to identify an effect of behavioural change on the progression of kidney disease.

        "title":"Predictors of acute kidney injury after lung resection surgery: a retrospective case-control study.",
        "abstract":"Patients undergoing lung resection are at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the immediate postoperative period, with important consequences for longer term morbidity and mortality. Lung resection surgery has unique considerations that could increase the risk of AKI, including lung resection volume, duration of one-lung ventilation (OLV), and intraoperative fluid restriction. Yet, specific risk factor data are lacking. The objective of this study was to identify independent risk factors for early AKI after lung resection surgery. We conducted a retrospective case-control study of all patients presenting for elective lung resection surgery at an academic medical centre over a four-year period. Cases were patients who experienced an AKI and control patients were those who did not experience an AKI, based on KDIGO criteria. Baseline demographics and comorbidities along with duration of OLV and amount of lung resected were collected by retrospective chart review. The data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify independent predictors of AKI. Acute kidney injury occurred within 48 hr in 57\/1,045 (5.5%; 95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 7.0) of patients. On multivariable analysis, our model of best fit included preoperative serum creatinine, male sex, use of angiotensin II receptor blockers, and duration of OLV. The rate of complications, intensive care unit admission, and risk of death were all higher in the group of patients who experienced AKI. Acute kidney injury occurs frequently after lung resection surgery and is associated with increased risk of postoperative complications. Increased duration of OLV may be a risk factor for AKI in this population. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: Les patient·es bénéficiant d’une résection pulmonaire courent un risque accru d’insuffisance rénale aiguë (IRA) en période postopératoire immédiate, avec des conséquences importantes pour la morbidité et la mortalité à long terme. La chirurgie de résection pulmonaire entraîne des considérations uniques qui pourraient augmenter le risque d’IRA, notamment le volume de la résection pulmonaire, la durée de la ventilation unipulmonaire (VUP) et la restriction liquidienne peropératoire. Pourtant, les données spécifiques sur les facteurs de risque font défaut. L’objectif de cette étude était d’identifier les facteurs de risque indépendants d’IRA précoce après une chirurgie de résection pulmonaire. MéTHODE: Nous avons mené une étude cas témoins rétrospective de toute la patientèle se présentant pour une chirurgie de résection pulmonaire non urgente dans un centre médical universitaire sur une période de quatre ans. Les cas étaient des patient·es qui ont présenté une IRA et des patient·es témoins qui n’ont pas eu d’IRA, selon les critères KDIGO. Les données démographiques et les comorbidités de base ainsi que la durée de la VUP et le volume de poumon réséqué ont été recueillis par examen rétrospectif des dossiers. Les données ont été analysées à l’aide d’une régression logistique multivariée afin d’identifier des prédicteurs indépendants d’IRA. RéSULTATS: Une insuffisance rénale aiguë est survenue dans les premières 48 heures postopératoires chez 57\/1045 (5,5 %; intervalle de confiance à 95 %, 4,2 à 7,0) des patient·es. Sur l’analyse multivariée, notre modèle de meilleur ajustement incluait la créatininémie préopératoire, le sexe masculin, l’utilisation d’antagonistes des récepteurs de l’angiotensine II et la durée de la VUP. Le taux de complications, l’admission en unité de soins intensifs et le risque de décès étaient tous plus élevés dans le groupe de patient·es ayant présenté une IRA. CONCLUSION: L’insuffisance rénale aiguë survient fréquemment après une chirurgie de résection pulmonaire et est associée à un risque accru de complications postopératoires. Une durée prolongée de VUP pourrait constituer un facteur de risque d’IRA dans cette population.",

        "abstract":"Nephroprotection is a set of recommendations that aim to prevent the risks of acute and\/or chronic renal failure and to limit the progression of renal failure towards an end stage. Nephroprotection is not limited to nephrology and applies to all patients at risk of renal failure. Cancer patients are particularly at risk of developing intrinsic and extrinsic renal failure, as well as the toxicity of specific treatments. However, they are poorly included in nephroprotection studies. Thus, current guidelines have not been adapted to these pathologies and oncology-specific comorbidities, such as malnutrition or prognosis, are often not taken into account. In this article, we review the established recommendations by transposing them to the cancer patient as a whole. In addition to the reminder of hygiene and dietary rules to control blood pressure and diabetes, we discuss the importance of therapeutic education, iatrogeny and treatment options to control renal failure in this context. The lack of clearly established data in cancer confirms the needs to strengthen links between oncologists, hematologists and nephrologists and reinforces the emergence of onco-nephrology as a new discipline.",

        "abstract":"People living with diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease can have difficulty attending multiple appointments to receive DM care. We developed and studied the utility of a DM outreach program to offer in the hemodialysis (HD) unit. We conducted a quality improvement project in a satellite HD unit in London, Ontario, Canada, between August 1, 2019, and July 31, 2022. We assessed for baseline gaps in DM care among those with DM, performed root-cause analysis with key stakeholders to identify critical drivers of gaps, and conceptualized a certified diabetes educator-led outreach program to offer in the HD unit. We aimed to improve DM self-monitoring, hypo- and hyperglycemia, and DM-related screening. We used run and control charts to track outcome measures over time and modified our outreach program iteratively. Fifty-eight persons with DM receiving HD participated in our program. Support spanned multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 4 tests of change, we observed improvement in DM self-monitoring with a modest decline in self-reported hyperglycemia. There were no adverse consequences, and satisfaction with our program was high. Although we did not meet all measures of success during the pandemic, outreach DM support in the HD unit appeared to improve self-monitoring and self-reported hyperglycemia. Similar programs could be modified and implemented in other centres.",

        "abstract":"Bee sting venom is generally well tolerated. However, some rare cases of massive stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and even renal failure. This observation is the illustration of a case of acute kidney injury secondary to bee stings in a 64-year-old black african subject. A 64-year-old man without a known medical history was referred to the emergency department of the Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes (Mali) for disturbed consciousness 4 hours after massive stings from a bee swarm. Renal failure with serum creatinine level at 752,2 µmol\/L was documented on day 3 in a context of total anuria. The patient was transferred to a nephrology unit and biology confirmed renal failure associated with intravascular haemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. The kidneys were of normal size and well differentiated. The diagnosis of severe acute kidney injury due to massive envenomation induced by bee venom was evoked. The evolution was favourable, with normalization of renal function at D26 after 5 sessions of haemodialysis in parallel with transfusions of packed red blood cells. A massive bee attack should be considered a medical emergency because of the organic damage it can inflict. The renal prognosis depends on the number of stings, and especially on the delay and the quality of the treatment. Early initiation of dialysis treatment reduces mortality. Le venin des piqûres d’abeilles est en général bien toléré. Cependant, quelques rares cas de piqûres massives peuvent entraîner un choc anaphylactique, voire une insuffisance rénale. Cette observation est l’illustration d’un cas d’insuffisance rénale aiguë par envenimation aux piqûres d’abeilles chez un sujet noir africain de 64 ans. Un homme de 64 ans sans antécédent médical connu, est adressé aux urgences de l’hôpital Fousseyni Daou de Kayes (Mali) pour trouble de la conscience 4 heures après des piqûres massives par un essaim d’abeilles. Une insuffisance rénale à 752,2 µmol\/L de créatinine est découverte à J3 dans un contexte d’anurie totale. Le patient est transféré en unité de néphrologie où la biologie confirme l’insuffisance rénale associée à une hémolyse intravasculaire et une rhabdomyolyse. Les reins étaient de taille normale et bien différenciés à l’échographie. Le diagnostic d’une insuffisance rénale aiguë sévère par envenimation massive induite par le venin d’abeille a été évoqué. L’évolution était favorable, marquée par une normalisation de la fonction rénale à J26 après cinq séances d’hémodialyse en parallèle à des transfusions de culot globulaire. L’attaque massive d’abeilles doit être considérée comme une urgence médicale en raison des atteintes organiques qu’elle peut entraîner. Le pronostic rénal dépend du nombre de piqûres, et surtout du délai et de la qualité de prise en charge. L’instauration rapide de l’épuration extrarénale permet de réduire la mortalité.",

Human activities must be redesigned to best adapt them to available resources and to reduce their deleterious impact on the planet. The Green Nephrology Group of the “Société française de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation” (SFNDT) has started a reflection on these issues, in particular on dialysis, a vital treatment but with high carbon production, associated with high water consumption. The data available on these points are presented such as, among others, the collection of indicators and action plans, the recycling of waste from water treatment, the reduction of dialysate flow, the reuse and regeneration of spent dialysate as well as calculations of carbon emission by dialysis activity. Architectural experiences are reported as well as the regulatory constraints applying to manufacturers and organizations in the sector. Potential solutions require the mobilization of all stakeholders, ranging from patients to health authorities, including caregivers, pharmacists, technicians, nephrologists and facility managers. They will be formalized very soon in a guide being prepared by the SFNDT Green Nephrology Group. La préservation de l’environnement devient une priorité universelle.

        "abstract":"Renal impairment is common during multiple myeloma and persistent reduction in kidney function strongly affects prognosis. Cast nephropathy, by monoclonal free light chains precipitation with uromodulin in renal tubules, is the main cause of acute kidney injury in multiple myeloma. Kidney biopsy, although not necessary for diagnosis, allows assessment of renal prognosis according to the extent of cast formation, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Prevention and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury are essential to optimize management and avoid progression to chronic kidney disease. Rehydration, interruption of nephrotoxic treatments, correction of precipitating factors, anti-plasma cell chemotherapy can rapidly reduce the free light chains nephrotoxicity. The association of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib and high dose Dexamethasone is the reference treatment in newly diagnosed patients with renal impairment. Adding Cyclophosphamide or the immunomodulator Lenalidomide may improve the hematological response, but with a poorer tolerance. Use of anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies is being evaluated in this population. Hemodialysis with high-flux or high-cut-off membranes, combined to chemotherapy, may improve renal function recovery. Management of multiple myeloma have to be adapted in patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis or kidney transplantation. Because of improvement in global survival, kidney transplantation remains an option to consider in selected patients.

AA amyloidosis complicates chronic inflammatory diseases, especially chronic inflammatory rheumatisms such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis; chronic infections such as tuberculosis, bronchectasia, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease; and auto-inflammatory diseases including familial Mediterranean fever. This work consists of the French guidelines for the diagnosis workup and treatment of AA amyloidosis. We estimate in France between 500 and 700 cases in the whole French population, affecting both men and women. The most frequent organ impaired is kidney which usually manifests by oedemas of the lower extremities, proteinuria, and\/or renal failure. Patients are usually tired and can display digestive features anf thyroid goiter. The diagnosis of AA amyloidosis is based on detection of amyloid deposits on a biopsy using Congo Red staining with a characteristic green birefringence in polarized light. Immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody directed against Serum Amyloid A protein is essential to confirm the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. Peripheral inflammatory biomarkers can be measured such as C Reactive protein and SAA. We propose an algorithm to guide the etiological diagnosis of AA amyloidosis. The treatement relies on the etiologic treatment of the undelying chronic inflammatory disease to decrease and\/or normalize Serum Amyloid A protein concentration in order to stabilize amyloidosis. In case of renal failure, dialysis or even a kidney transplant can be porposed. Nowadays, there is currently no specific treatment for AA amyloidosis deposits which constitutes a therapeutic challenge for the future.",

Nowadays, this concept is being questioned. Patients with severe renal failure and\/or ARF are the only group still considered at risk. In these patients, it is necessary to discuss an alternative without an iodinated contrast agent. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound, MRI, spectral CT or PET-CT scan can be used instead of contrast-enhanced CT. Preventive measures should be applied when appropriate substitute to CT is not available or not diagnosed (minimum necessary dose of ICP, interruption of some treatments and prior hydration). These recommendations formalized by the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) in 2018 address most situations faced by clinicians. In complex situations, an opinion from a nephrologist remains necessary after asking the radiologist about the availability of acceptable substitutes.",

In case of resistance to medical treatment (native and active vitamin D, calcium and calcimimetics), surgical parathyroidectomy is indicated. The aim of this retrospective study is to show the evolution of the incidence and results of surgical parathyroidectomy in our center between 1980 and 2020 as patient characteristics, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have changed. We collected data from dialysis patients who had a first surgical parathyroidectomy between 2000 and 2020 (period 2) in the same surgical department and compared them with historical data between 1980 and 1999 (period 1) operated in one other center. In period 1, 53 surgical parathyroidectomy were performed (2.78\/year, 0 to 5, 8.5\/1000 patients-year) vs.56 surgical parathyroidectomy in period 2 (2.8\/year, 0 to 9, 8\/1000 patients-year). The patients of the 2 periods were comparable except for the higher dialysis vintage in period 1 (149±170 vs.89±94 months; P=0.02). In comparison with dialysis patients not requiring surgical parathyroidectomy during the same period, patients who had surgical parathyroidectomy were younger, had higher dialysis vintage and lower diabetes prevalence, but more frequently carriers of glomerulopathy or polycystosis. Systematically performed in period 2, cervical ultrasound identified at least one visible gland in 78.6% of cases while the scintigraphy, performed only in 66% of cases, found at least one gland in 81% of cases. Twelve months after surgery, PTH > 300 pg\/mL (marker of secondary hyperparathyroidism recurrence or surgery failure) was present in 30% of patients in period 1 vs. 5.3% in period 2. Hypoparathyroidism was also more frequently observed in period 2 (35.7 vs. 18.8%). Surgical complications were also higher in period 1. Despite therapeutic and strategic advances, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism is still as common as ever. It is favored by excessively high PTH targets, by suboptimal prevention before dialysis and poor tolerance of calcimimetics. The surgical parathyroidectomy is effective and safe in the hands of a specialized team with an ultrasound and scintigraphic preoperative assessment.",

This retrospective single-center study was conducted between June 2023 and June 2024. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (> 18 years) with radiologically confirmed renal stones smaller than 15 mm in diameter. Exclusion criteria included patients with solitary kidneys, significant renal functional deterioration, skeletal deformities, active urinary tract infections, pregnancy, or coagulopathies. Treatment outcomes were collected and analyzed in detail, considering patients' demographic characteristics (age, gender) and stone parameters (size, location, and hardness [Hounsfield Unit, HU]). The SWL procedures were performed using the Modulith SLK Inline lithotripter (Storz Medical, Switzerland). The success of SWL was defined as achieving complete stone clearance or the presence of clinically insignificant residual fragments (CIRF) (< 4 mm). This study seeks to provide detailed insights into the optimal use cases of SWL as a non-invasive yet effective treatment option for smaller, more manageable stones. The mean age of the 208 patients included in the study was 42.2 ± 12.7 years (18-75), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.9:1. The mean stone size across all patients was 10.3 mm, and the average HU value was 874.0 ± 283.2. Patients who achieved a completely stone-free status had significantly lower HU values (p = 0.049). The overall success rate of SWL was 78.8%, with 164 patients achieving complete stone clearance. When cases with clinically insignificant residual fragments (CIRF, < 4 mm) were included as successful outcomes, the overall success rate increased to 92.3%. This distinction highlights the inclusion of patients with small residual fragments that are deemed clinically irrelevant in the adjusted success rate. In cases with successful outcomes, the mean stone size was 10.3 mm, whereas it was 12.5 mm in patients with residual fragments or treatment failure. A statistically significant relationship was identified between stone size and treatment success rates (p < 0.001). In contrast, stone localization did not have a significant impact on SWL success rates (p = 0.377). SWL has demonstrated its effectiveness in kidney stone treatment with a 78.8% complete stone-free rate using the Modulith SLK Inline lithotripter. Higher success rates were achieved with smaller stones (< 15 mm) and lower HU values. These findings support the significance of advanced lithotripter technology in establishing SWL as a valuable non-invasive option for stones under 15 mm.",

Work-up revealed a high-risk smoldering myeloma without sufficient evidence of plasma cell-mediated orbital inflammation on the first biopsy samples.

The development of device-based therapies to provide support in these cases is an attractive alternative therapeutic option. This review will describe the growing evidence supporting developments in device-based therapies for cardiorenal syndrome in patients with heart failure. We describe multiple emerging technologies in this space, each classified according to its mechanism of action. 'Pushers' are devices that increase blood flow and perfusion pressure to the renal arteries. 'Pullers' reduce renal afterload by decreasing pressure in the renal veins, and 'fluid shifters' decongest the interstitium through the lymphatic system. While early results from small clinical studies piloting these devices are promising, randomized controlled trials are needed to fully evaluate their utility in patients with heart failure. In the future, these devices may work synergistically with pharmacologic therapy to reduce average inpatient length of stay, hospitalization rates, and potentially improve mortality.",

        "abstract":"Renal fibrosis is a common mechanism leading to kidney failure in chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), including obstructive nephropathy (ON). Dysregulated inflammation is central to the development of renal fibrosis, but how local immune cells within the tissue microenvironment integrate and coordinate to drive this condition remains largely unknown. Herein, we documented that neutrophils were abundantly recruited and expelled neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in human and mouse fibrotic kidneys. Importantly, circulating levels of NET components displayed a significant correlation with worsened kidney function in ON patients. In the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model, blocking NETs by protein-arginine deiminase type 4 (PAD4) deletion or DNase treatment significantly impaired NET formation and inhibited renal fibrosis and inflammation, whereas NET adoptive transfer exacerbated the fibrotic process. Moreover, NET-mediated renal fibrosis was associated with enhanced infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which produced granzyme B (GZMB) to drive tubular cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblast activation. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of GZMB resulted in blunted kidney inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, NETs profoundly potentiated the production of T-cell chemokines CXCL9\/10\/11 in macrophages, but not in tubular cells or fibroblasts, thus driving T-cell infiltration and fueling inflammatory cascades in the kidneys. Mechanistically, the NET-macrophage interaction was partially mediated by the TLR2\/4 signaling. Thus, our work reveals a previously unexplored role of the collaboration between NETs and macrophages in supporting CD8+ T cell infiltration, which orchestrates kidney inflammation and fibrosis.",

While brown tumors commonly affect bones rich in marrow, the involvement of the sphenoid sinus is extremely rare and can present with neurological symptoms. This study reports a case of a sphenoid sinus brown tumor in a patient on hemodialysis, highlighting its clinical presentation and diagnostic challenges. A 31-year-old woman undergoing chronic hemodialysis presented with a severe headache, diplopia, and progressive vision loss in her left eye. Laboratory tests revealed hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, consistent with SHPT. The diagnosis was confirmed through a clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The clinical examination confirmed decreased visual acuity in the left eye. The laboratory results revealed serum calcium of 15.5 mg\/dL, phosphate of 1.0 mg\/dL, and PTH of 2000 pg\/mL, consistent with SHPT. The imaging studies identified a brown tumor in the sphenoid sinus exerting a mass effect on adjacent structures. This case underscores the rarity of brown tumors in this location, with very few similar reports in the literature. Although rare, brown tumors should be considered in patients with SHPT who present with neurological symptoms or cranial lesions. An early diagnosis through biochemical and imaging studies is crucial to prevent severe complications.

        "abstract":"In clinical practice, heart failure (HF) and osteoporosis (OP) are commonly paired conditions. This association is particularly relevant in patients over the age of 50, among whom its prevalence increases dramatically with every decade of life. This can be especially impactful since patient prognosis when facing both conditions is poorer than that of each disease alone. Clinical studies suggest that prior fractures increase the risk for heart failure hospitalization and, conversely, an episode of heart failure increases the risk of subsequent fractures. In other words, the relationship between osteoporosis and heart failure seems to be two-way, meaning that each condition may influence or contribute to the development of the other. However, the details of the pathophysiological relationship between HF and OP have yet to be revealed. The two conditions share multiple pathological mechanisms that seem to be intertwined. Patients affected by OP are more prone to develop HF because of vitamin D deficiency, elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) plasma levels, and increased Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23) activity. On the other hand, HF patients are more prone to develop OP and pathological fractures because of low vitamin D level, high PTH, chronic renal failure, alteration of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, reduced testosterone level, and metabolic effects derived from commonly used medications. Considering the increasingly aging worldwide population, clinicians can expect to see more often an overlap between these two conditions. Thus, it becomes crucial to recognize how HF and OP mutually influence the patient's clinical condition. Clinicians attending these patients should utilize an integrated approach and, in order to improve prognosis, aim for early diagnosis and treatment initiation. The aim of this paper is to perform a review of the common pathophysiological mechanisms of OP and HF and identify potentially new treatment targets.",

        "abstract":"Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) continues to be a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the evolution of evidence-based management strategies. This literature review examines the most recent updates from the 2023 and 2024 hypertension guidelines issued by the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). These guidelines are compared with previous key recommendations, such as the 2017 American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association guidelines and the 2018 ESC\/ESH guidelines. The updated recommendations reflect a paradigm shift in the approach to hypertension diagnosis and management, including a stricter systolic blood pressure (BP) target of 120-129 mmHg, which underscores the importance of early and precise BP control. The difference between the classification of \"elevated BP\" and hypertension in the ESC versus ESH guidelines, particularly, regarding their implications for early detection and prevention of HHD, are critically examined, highlighting areas of clinical and academic debate. The introduction of a new \"elevated BP\" category (120-139\/70-89 mmHg) highlights a proactive strategy aimed at identifying at-risk individuals earlier in the disease course to prevent progression to HHD. Additionally, the divergent roles of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), including HHD, in risk stratification as recommended by the ESC and ESH are discussed, emphasising their significance in tailoring management approaches. For patients with resistant hypertension, the 2023 and 2024 updates also endorse innovative therapies, such as renal denervation, an interventional procedure that has demonstrated significant promise in managing treatment-resistant cases. This review synthesises these updates, focusing on their implications for clinical practice in diagnosing and managing HHD. By emphasising aggressive intervention and the integration of novel treatment modalities, the review aims to bridge existing gaps in earlier approaches to hypertension management. The critical evaluation of guideline discrepancies and evolving evidence seeks to provide clinicians with a nuanced understanding to optimise outcomes for patients with HHD, particularly considering emerging therapeutic possibilities and more stringent BP control targets.",

Data on 22 patient variables were extracted, including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), procedure length, surgical complexity, and length of hospital stay. Logistic regression analysis was used for feature selection to identify AKI predictors, and an extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) model was applied to all variables related to AKI events. The incidence of postoperative AKI was 6.72% (n=9). Predictive factors for AKI included younger age (OR = 0.942, p=0.037), lower CCI (OR = 0.415, p=0.015), longer procedure duration (OR = 1.006, p=0.019), and greater surgical effort (OR = 1.427, p=0.007). Patients with perioperative AKI experienced a doubling in the length of hospital stay (p=0.008). Mortality rates were similar between patients with and without AKI. AI-driven algorithms highlighted the complexity of AKI prediction and provided individual risk profiles, enabling future stratification and prompting different frequencies of AKI monitoring following cytoreduction. Predicting AKI is a complex task. This study found a lower-than-expected incidence of AKI following advanced EOC cytoreductive surgery. AKI is linked to heightened surgical risk-taking, underscoring the need for improved guidelines focusing on postoperative monitoring for targeted patients. Artificial Intelligence offers the potential for personalized AKI prediction.",

        "abstract":"Renal transplants have been increasing in number due to the rise in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. Transplant is a good approach to management of renal disease, as it offers patients a better quality of life. However, complications such as acute graft rejection remain a concern in all transplant patients. Basiliximab is an antibody commonly used as part of acute rejection prevention in renal transplantation. This antibody has been demonstrated to have comparable efficacy as other agents currently used, with the added benefit of decreasing the amount of steroids required for adequate immunosuppression. The general side effect profile for basiliximab includes infection, gastrointestinal disturbance, hypertension, and hyperkalemia. Respiratory system-related effects include dyspnea and upper respiratory tract infections, most of which have been documented to be mild or moderate in severity. However, a search of the literature reveals that there are a few reported cases of severe respiratory side effects in patients receiving basiliximab after renal transplants. In this report, we discuss two separate cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that occurred in two young male patients. Both patients were without any other comorbidities, who had recently undergone renal transplantation and received basiliximab as part of acute rejection prevention. Both cases have a similar timeline of symptom onset, and both patients quickly developed severe respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for respiratory support. Analysis of possible causes of respiratory failure points to a common medication that was administered to both patients. This report adds to a growing number of cases that suggest basiliximab may play a role in the development of respiratory failure in young patients undergoing renal transplantation surgery.",

A total of 608 patients with normal renal function who underwent heart valve replacement from November 2013 to June 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. The Lasso regression was used to preliminarily screen potential risk factors, which were entered into the multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify preoperative independent risk factors for postoperative AKI. Based on the results, a risk prediction model was developed, and traditional and dynamic nomograms were constructed. The risk prediction model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). 220 patients (36.2%) developed AKI after surgery. Current smoker, hypertension, heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, CysC, and NT-proBNP were selected as independent risk factors for AKI. A risk prediction model, a traditional and a dynamic nomogram were developed based on the above factors. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC for predicting the risk of postoperative AKI was 0.803 (95% CI 0.769-0.836), with sensitivity and specificity of 84.9% and 63.4%, respectively. The calibration curve slope was close to 1, and the DCA showed that the model produced better clinical benefits when the probability threshold was set at 10%-82%. We developed a preoperative risk prediction model for AKI after heart valve replacement in patients with normal renal function, which demonstrated satisfactory discrimination and calibration.",

Conventional methods that involve hemoperfusion, hemodialysis, and hemofiltration possess several weaknesses, including loss of plasma components and inefficient clearance of high molecular weight solutes. This review explores current developments in blood purification techniques particularly stimuli-responsive polymers for use in extracorporeal therapy among other applications. Many aspects of engineering stimuli-responsive polymers are described in terms of their role in the removal of small soluble molecules and toxins in blood purification techniques. The development of stimuli-responsive systems has introduced a new paradigm in blood purification by enabling selective, on-demand control of polymer parameters in response to external stimuli such as temperature, pH, electrolytes, and light. Such advanced materials have been demonstrated potential for toxin clearance, minimizing thrombosis, and improving blood compatibility and antifouling, which are far much better than traditional approaches. Furthermore, the review presents a perspective on stimuli-responsive polymers that could be used in developing novel extracorporeal systems for future medical purposes.",

Conversely, the parasympathetic system, through cholinergic signalling, inhibits osteoclast activity, promoting bone formation and maintaining skeletal homeostasis. This review presents the role of the autonomic nervous system, with particular focus on the potential role of β-blockers, especially β1-selective blockers, in modulating bone health in people with normal kidney function and those with CKD. While early studies with non-selective β-blockers like propranolol showed mixed results, recent findings in postmenopausal women suggested that β1-selective β-blockers could enhance bone density by modulating sympathetic activity. Trial emulation using large databases and eventually randomized controlled trials are needed to test the hypothesis that β-blockade can favourably impact bone disease in patients with kidney failure.",

        "abstract":"Medical education in France has undergone several major reforms in recent years. In 2017, the reform of the third cycle of medical studies was implemented. This particularly affected nephrology. The reform introduced a new status of “junior doctor”. Its main objective is to ensure the transition from intern to senior doctor. The “Syndicat National des Internes de Néphrologie” (SNIN) conducted a survey to take stock of this new status in our specialty. The respondents were contacted through their city referents. We received 53 completed questionnaires from Nephrology junior-doctors with an average age of 29 years from all over France. The choice of assignment was satisfactory in 93% of cases. The activity of these juniors-doctors was mainly oriented towards clinical nephrology or was mixed, with the possibility of own consultations for almost all residents. The on-call or nightshift activity of the junior-doctors was mainly concentrated in their home department, with only one third of them working as substitute. Their weekly working hours were substantial (mostly between 45 and 65 hours\/week), with a significant number exceeding the legal limit. Overall, supervision was considered satisfactory. Very few residents had time for research or theorical-learning, although some gave lessons and received training mainly through conferences. Progress in performing renal biopsies was substantial, in contrast to central venous catheter placement and peritoneal dialysis management, where progress was judged to be weak. Les études médicales en France ont fait l’objet, au cours de ces dernières années, de plusieurs réformes profondes. En 2017, la réforme du troisième cycle des études médicales a été mise en application. Celle-ci concernait notamment la néphrologie. Avec cette réforme, un nouveau statut de « Docteur Junior » (Dr Junior) a vu le jour. Celui-ci a comme objectif majeur d’assurer la transition entre le statut d’interne et le statut de médecin senior. À travers un questionnaire réalisé par le Syndicat national des internes de néphrologie (SNIN), nous avons décidé de réaliser le bilan de ce nouveau statut dans notre spécialité. Les répondants ont été contactés via les référents de ville. Nous avons obtenu 53 questionnaires remplis par des Drs Juniors en néphrologie, d’une médiane d’âge de 29 ans, répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire français. Les choix d’affectation étaient satisfaisants dans 93 % des cas. L’activité de ces Drs Juniors était surtout orientée vers la néphrologie clinique, ou était mixte, avec la possibilité d’avoir ses propres consultations pour quasi tous les internes. Les Drs Juniors ont une activité de garde ou d’astreinte principalement centrée sur leur service d’origine, seul un tiers effectuait des remplacements. Leur volume horaire hebdomadaire était conséquent (majoritairement entre 45 et 65 h\/semaine) avec un dépassement du cadre légal pour un nombre non négligeable. La supervision était globalement jugée satisfaisante. Très peu de Drs Juniors avaient du temps bien sanctuarisé pour la recherche ou la formation, néanmoins certains donnaient des cours et profitaient de formation principalement via les congrès. La progression sur la réalisation de biopsie rénale était conséquente contrairement à la pose de cathéters centraux ou à la gestion de la dialyse péritonéale où la progression était jugée faible.",

        "abstract":"Proper management of lithiasis-related diseases is essential, as they often cause pain that can be difficult to alleviate, leading to significant morbidity and substantial healthcare costs. In rare cases, lithiasis may indicate a more serious underlying condition that could progress to chronic kidney disease. The French Association of Urology (AFU) provides recommendations for the initial assessment of any patient experiencing a first episode of lithiasis, emphasizing the importance of stone analysis, dietary assessment, and crystalluria analysis when available. Simple measures, such as ensuring adequate hydration and a balanced intake of sodium, protein, and calcium, can help reduce the risk of stone formation in most cases. The use of a crystallization inhibitor, such as citrate, may also be indicated. Additional treatments may be considered depending on the stone type and any underlying biochemical abnormalities. These guidelines also describe criteria leading to a more comprehensive secondary evaluation, which may reveal conditions such as hyperoxaluria. This condition can be dietary, secondary to malabsorption, or due to genetic causes, such as primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Diagnosing PH is particularly crucial in the case of type 1 PH, as it can lead to renal failure and systemic oxalate accumulation, with a high risk of immediate recurrence in transplanted kidneys. Before the advent of RNA interference (siRNA) therapies, conservative treatment options—such as pyridoxine, hyperhydration, and crystallization inhibitors—were the primary strategies to slow the progression toward renal failure, with combined liver-kidney transplantation considered for end-stage renal disease. Current approaches now favor isolated kidney transplantation with adjunctive siRNA therapy, although this strategy requires careful, case-by-case consideration. Il est important de prendre en charge correctement une maladie lithiasique puisqu’elle entraîne une douleur parfois difficile à soulager ainsi qu’une morbidité significative et des coûts de santé substantiels. Dans certains cas rares, la maladie lithiasique est témoin d’une pathologie sous-jacente plus sévère pouvant conduire à une maladie rénale chronique. Il existe des recommandations françaises de l’Association française d’urologie (AFU) détaillant le bilan initial de tout patient ayant fait un premier épisode de maladie lithiasique mais précisant aussi l’importance de l’analyse du calcul, du bilan diététique ainsi que de la cristallurie quand elle est disponible. De simples mesures à type d’hydratation abondante, de consommation sodée, protéique et calcique équilibrée permettront dans la majorité des cas de réduire le risque lithiasique. L’ajout d’un inhibiteur de cristallisation tel que le citrate de potassium peut parfois être indiqué. D’autres thérapeutiques peuvent être discutées en fonction de l’origine du calcul et des anomalies biologiques sous-jacentes. Ces recommandations précisent également les conditions qui conduiront à la réalisation d’un bilan secondaire plus poussé. Ce bilan pourra faire découvrir l’existence, entre autres, d’une hyperoxalurie, qui pourra être diététique, secondaire à une malabsorption ou d’origine génétique (hyperoxalurie primaire [HP]). Le diagnostic d’HP a toute son importance car cette pathologie conduit (notamment dans l’HP type 1) à une défaillance rénale, ainsi qu’à l’accumulation d’oxalate systémique, avec un risque de récidive immédiat sur le greffon. Avant l’avènement des ARN interférents (siRNA), le traitement conservateur (pyridoxine, hyperhydratation, inhibiteurs de la cristallisation) était la seule option pour ralentir l’évolution vers la défaillance rénale, la double greffe foie-rein était proposée lors de la défaillance rénale. La tendance actuelle est à la greffe de rein seule avec adjonction de siRNA mais doit être discutée au cas par cas.",

        "abstract":"Creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equations are widely used in clinical practice but exhibit inherent limitations. On the other side, measuring GFR is time consuming and not available in routine clinical practice. We developed and validated machine learning models to assess the trustworthiness (i.e. the ability of equations to estimate measured GFR (mGFR) within 10%, 20% or 30%) of the European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) equation at the individual level. This observational study used data from European and US cohorts, comprising 22,343 participants of all ages with available mGFR results. Four machine learning and two traditional logistic regression models were trained on a cohort of 9,202 participants to predict the likelihood of the EKFC creatinine-derived eGFR falling within 30% (p30), 20% (p20) or 10% (p10) of the mGFR value. The algorithms were internally and then externally validated on cohorts of respectively 3,034 and 10,107 participants. The predictors included in the models were creatinine, age, sex, height, weight, and EKFC. The random forest model was the most robust model. In the external validation cohort, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.675 (95%CI 0.660;0.690) and an accuracy of 0.716 (95%CI 0.707;0.725) for the P30 criterion. Sensitivity was 0.756 (95%CI 0.747;0.765) and specificity was 0.485 (95%CI 0.460; 0.511) at the 80% probability level that EKFC falls within 30% of mGFR. At the population level, the PPV of this machine learning model was 89.5%, higher than the EKFC P30 of 85.2%. A free web-application was developed to allow the physician to assess the trustworthiness of EKFC at the individual level. A strategy using machine learning model marginally improves the trustworthiness of GFR estimation at the population level. An additional value of this approach lies in its ability to provide assessments at the individual level.",

        "abstract":"Script Concordance Tests (SCTs) represent an innovative assessment method which have been introduced in the 2024 French National Ranking Examinations (EDN). These tests compare a student's clinical reasoning with that of a panel of experts under conditions of uncertainty. Typically, the question involves the impact of new information on an initially proposed hypothesis, with answers given on a Likert scale. This article aims to didactically illustrate how SCTs are consistent with probabilistic reasoning as modeled by Bayes' theorem. In addition, by comparing SCT writing guidelines with Bayesian reasoning concepts, several ambiguities were identified: (1) What stage of clinical reasoning do SCTs evaluate? (2) What are the appropriate labels for Likert scale responses? (3) Does the expert panel provide a relevant reference for SCTs? Currently, many of these questions remain unanswered in the literature, with recent data suggesting that experienced physicians' responses to SCTs are often biased. Beyond their use as an assessment tool in the EDN, SCTs offer a valuable opportunity to develop and deepen the teaching of probabilistic reasoning in medical education and serve as a potential area of research to improve clinical practice.",

        "abstract":"Although post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common complication after kidney transplantation, there are few data on prevention, optimal screening, and treatment strategies. The European Renal Association's DESCARTES working group distributed a web-based survey to European transplant centres to gather information on risk assessment, screening procedures, and management practices for preventing and treating PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. Answers were obtained from 121\/241 transplant centres (50%) across 15 European countries. Screening practices for diabetes mellitus during the transplant work-up varied, with only 13% of centres using the recommended oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 14% not screening at all. At transplantation, 19% of centres tailored the immunosuppressive regimen based on perceived PTDM risk, using strategies such as cyclosporin use or early steroid withdrawal. Fifty-two percent adopted strict glycaemic control with basal insulin in the first days post-transplant. Sixty-eight percent had defined screening protocols for early PTDM (45 days-6 months), primarily based on fasting glycaemia and\/or HbA1c, while only a minority (7%) incorporated an OGTT. Changes in immunosuppression were considered by 41% in cases of early hyperglycaemia (<45 days) and by 58% in established PTDM (>45 days). Besides insulin therapy, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and metformin were most frequently used to manage early hyperglycaemia (<45 days) and PTDM (>45 days). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-analogues increased >45 days post-transplantation. This European survey underscores the significant variation in PTDM prevention, screening, and treatment practices, emphasizing the imperative for more explicit guidance in approaching this complication.",

        "abstract":": With more than 60 million new cases around the world each year, traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes substantial mortality and morbidity. Managing TBI is a major human, social, and economic concern. In the last 20 years, there has been an increase in clinical trials in neurocritical care, leading mostly to negative results. The evaluation of neurological outcomes, predominantly as primary outcomes, using clinical scales (Glasgow Outcome Scale) has limitations that could explain these results. Moreover, patient-centered outcomes are seldom reported despite their recognized clinical relevance. : The aim of this project is to establish a core outcome set (COS) for patients with moderate-to-severe TBI in randomized control trials in neurocritical care research. This study will follow five distinct steps: (1) systematic review to identify outcomes that have been reported in trials; (2) semistructured interviews with patients and their families to identify their priorities after TBI and explore potential patient-centered outcomes; (3) health care stakeholder focus groups with clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to describe potential outcomes; (4) an eDelphi survey with stakeholder groups to make a list of previously identified core outcomes; and (5) a consensus workshop to establish a COS for moderate-to-severe TBI clinical trials. : The systematic review was published in August 2024. Regarding Step 2, 30 semistructured interviews of patients and relatives were performed from July 2021 to December 2023, and analyses were completed in October 2024. Step 3 is currently under development, and Step 4 is planned for the end of 2025. Step 5 is expected to occur during fall\/winter 2026. Conclusions: Establishing a COS, to be consistently measured and reported in TBI trials in neurocritical care will ensure rigorous reporting, avoid bias, and improve the integrity, transparency, and usability of clinical research. The French context of the study is the main limitation, but we are seeking international collaboration on the project. The results of each step of the project will be disseminated through abstracts, publications, and patient associations.

This longitudinal study included 9332 incident hemodialysis patients from the EuCliD database, treated in Fresenius Medical Care NephroCare dialysis centers across seven countries between January 2016 and December 2019, with follow-up until May 2023. Fluid overload was assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy, and patients were grouped based on fluid overload trajectories using group-based trajectory modeling. Cox regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to investigate the relationship between trajectory groups and mortality. Four distinct fluid overload trajectories were identified. Patients in the highest trajectory group (8.5% of the cohort) had more frequent background cardiovascular complications, lower BMI and serum albumin, and their adjusted mortality risk was 2.20 times higher than the lowest trajectory. There was a dose-response relationship between trajectories and mortality.

        "abstract":"Monoallelic predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in IFT140 have recently been associated with an autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-like phenotype. This study enhanced the characterization of this phenotype. Case series. Seventy-five among 2,797 European individuals with ADPKD-like phenotypes who underwent genetic testing that revealed pLoF IFT140-variants. The 75 individuals (median age 56 years, 53.3% females) were from 61 families and were found to have 41 different monoallelic pLoF IFT140-variants. The majority of individuals presented with large, exophytic kidney cysts (median total kidney volume, 688mL [IQR, 201-4,139]), and 90.2% were classified using the Mayo Imaging Classification as Mayo Class 2A. Arterial hypertension was present in 50.7% of the individuals (median age at diagnosis, 59 years [IQR, 29-73]). Only 1 patient developed kidney failure (at age 69 years). A significant difference was observed in the age-adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between the male and female patients (P<0.001), and 56.3% of the individuals over the age of 60 years had an eGFR of<60mL\/min\/1.73m Retrospective study; IFT140-related cystic kidney disease may not be diagnosed in younger patients or patients with milder forms. Individuals with monoallelic IFT140 pLoF variants are likely to develop kidney cysts atypical of classic ADPKD and generally have a favorable kidney prognosis. Monoallelic pathogenic variants in IFT140 have been linked to a spectrum of kidney disease clinically similar to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). This article describes a case series of 75 individuals with ADPKD-IFT140. Affected individuals typically presented with an atypical imaging pattern, had fewer but larger kidney cysts compared with classic ADPKD, and rarely developed liver cysts. Although the kidney prognosis appeared better than in classic ADPKD, 56.3% of individuals over 60 years of age had stage 3 or more severe CKD. Individuals with ADPKD-IFT140 variants are likely to develop kidney cyst patterns atypical of ADPKD. Their kidney prognosis appears favorable.",

However there is limited evidence on the burden of CKD according to uACR categories at the population level. This study estimates future clinical and financial burden of CKD according to uACR categories using the Inside CKD microsimulation. The Inside CKD model is an individual patient level microsimulation that emulates national populations based on demographic, epidemiological, and economic data. The analysis estimates clinical and economic outcomes over time according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) uACR categories (A1-A3) at a population level for 31 countries and regions. CKD populations (diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals, stages G3-G5) were projected to be predominantly within uACR categories A1 and A2 in 2022. Projected cumulative incidence of CKD stage transitions (disease progression) and cardio-renal complications (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality) occurred mostly in uACR categories A1 and A2 between 2022 and 2027. Patients in uACR categories A1 and A2, who represent the largest proportion of patients with CKD, were projected to incur most of the health care costs associated with CKD management and cardio-renal complications for the diagnosed population (prevalence 2027). This study highlights the disproportionate population-level clinical and economic burden associated with individuals within KDIGO uACR categories A1 and A2, who represent most of the CKD population. This awareness will help health care decision makers to appropriately allocate resources and interventions to the CKD population, including those with mild to moderately increased albuminuria, to reduce clinical and economic burden associated with CKD.",

However, the disease often relapses, which can impact allograft survival. We conducted a prospective multicenter study in France involving 72 patients with membranous nephropathy who were awaiting and then underwent kidney transplantation. In addition, we established a retrospective validation cohort of 65 patients. The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic significance of pretransplant anti phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) antibodies on the recurrence of membranous nephropathy. The study also assessed the incidence rate, time to onset, and risk factors for recurrence, as well as allograft outcome. The prospective cohort showed a 26% cumulative incidence of membranous nephropathy recurrence after a median follow-up of 23.5 months. This was confirmed by a 28% cumulative incidence after a median follow-up of 67 months in the retrospective cohort. A strong association was found between the presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation and the risk of disease recurrence (risk ratio = 5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3-15.7;  The presence of anti-PLA2R1 antibodies prior to transplantation was a strong predictor of recurrence of allograft membranous nephropathy.

This multicenter retrospective study focused on patients genotyped with pathogenic COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 variants (classified as ACMG-AMP 4 or 5) between January 2011 and January 2023 across four French university hospitals. The study aimed to compare characteristics between two groups based on the presence or absence of MKC, defined by three or more cysts per kidney. The MKC group was compared to a control group with negative exome sequencing results for undetermined kidney disease (ES-UKD) to assess the association between MKC and AS. Among the 257 AS patients included, 38 (14.8%) presented MKC without variation from hereditary cystic kidney panel. MKC showed a significant association with male gender (p=0.004), cardiovascular risk factors, and loss of function variants (p=0.012). KF onset appeared significantly later, by 6 years, in MKC patients (p=0.035). Comparison with ES-UKD (n=990) control group showed no significant association between AS and MKC by univariate and multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis identified patient age and male gender (p<0.001) as factors linked to MKC. A 14.8% prevalence of MKC was found in our cohort of 257 patients with AS. MKC-AS patients exhibited clinical and histological characteristic akin to nephroangiosclerosis. Our comprehensive analysis, incorporating a sizable ES-UKD cohort, revealed no significant association between MKC and AS, thus questioning the inclusion of MKC within the spectrum of AS.",

        "abstract":"Hypertension is the most common chronic disease and a major modifiable risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular and renal diseases. This study estimated the national burden of hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, on morbidity and mortality in 2021 in France. For all diseases causally associated with hypertension (cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and dementia), the number and proportion of cases attributable to hypertension in adults aged ≥35 years were estimated using population attributable fractions. Age- and sex-specific population attributable fractions were computed using the distribution of hypertension in the French population. These population attributable fractions were applied to nationwide statistics for mortality, hospitalizations, disease prevalence, years of life lost, years of life lived with disability, and disability-adjusted years of life. The largest population attributable fractions were for ischemic heart disease and hemorrhagic stroke, with over 40% of cases attributable to hypertension. Overall, more than 385 000 patients were hospitalized due to hypertension, with 3.7 million hospitalizations and 6.2 million hospital days (all hospitalizations, including 3.4 million for chronic kidney disease) and including 390 000 overnight hospitalization. In 2021, more than 1.15 million individuals lived with ischemic heart disease attributable to hypertension, 1.26 million with chronic kidney diseases, and 358 033 with heart failure. Among 184 059 annual deaths from cardiovascular diseases, dementia, and chronic kidney diseases, 30% (55 280 deaths) were attributable to hypertension. Hypertension accounted for 8.5% of all deaths and 498 052 years of life lost. In France, despite near-universal health coverage and free health care access, the burden attributable to hypertension remains high.",

However, diagnosis often occurs at the end-stage of renal failure. To understand this delay, collecting real-world data on the clinical practices of nephrologists may be helpful. Between October 2021 and October 2022, a retrospective survey was conducted in France among 76 nephrologists to assess management practices for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown aetiology, associated with urinary lithiasis and\/or nephrocalcinosis. Data on patient profiles, tests conducted, diagnoses considered, and management of suspected PH cases were collected. 97% of patients (n = 386\/400) underwent a renal examination, 92% (n = 370\/400) a thorough urinary check-up, and 65% (n = 260\/400) had an interpretable oxaluria value from a 24-hour urine sample (Uox24h). Of these 260 patients, 50% (n = 130\/260) had Uox24h > 500 µmol\/24 h: 23% (n = 30\/130) were suspected of PH by the nephrologists, and 15% (n = 19\/130) were referred for genotyping. Considering all criteria, 52 patients were suspected of PH (42% of whom did not have Uox24h > 500 µmol\/24 h), and 33% (n = 17\/52) were not referred for genotyping. The survey highlights nephrologists' adherence to recommendations for prescribing biological tests. However, in cases of hyperoxaluria or suspected PH, genotyping was not always prescribed. The barriers to this prescription need further exploration. Les hyperoxaluries primitives (HP) sont des maladies génétiques rares et graves. Leur pronostic est amélioré par une prise en charge précoce. Or, le diagnostic est souvent établi au stade de l’insuffisance rénale terminale. Pour comprendre ce retard, la collecte des données en vie réelle sur des pratiques cliniques des néphrologues peut s’avérer utile. Entre octobre 2021 et octobre 2022, une enquête rétrospective sur les pratiques de prise en charge des patients avec une maladie rénale chronique d’étiologie inconnue associée à des lithiases urinaires et\/ou néphrocalcinose a été conduite en France, auprès de 76 néphrologues. Des données sur le profil des patients, les examens réalisés, les diagnostics envisagés, et la prise en charge en cas de suspicion d’HP ont été collectées. 97 % des patients (n = 386\/400) bénéficiaient d’un bilan rénal, 92 % (n = 370\/400) d’un bilan urinaire approfondi, et 65 % (n = 260\/400) avaient une valeur d’oxalurie sur les urines de 24 heures (Uox24h) interprétable. Sur ces 260 patients, 50 % (n = 130\/260) avaient une Uox24h > 500 µmol\/24 h : 23 % (n = 30\/130) étaient suspectés d’HP selon les néphrologues, et 15 % (n = 19\/130) faisaient l’objet d’une demande de génotypage. Tous critères pris en compte, 52 patients étaient suspectés d’HP (dont 42 % sans valeur d’Uox24h > 500 µmol\/24 h), et 33 % (n = 17\/52) ne faisaient pas l’objet d’une demande de génotypage. L’enquête souligne le respect des recommandations par les néphrologues pour la prescription des tests biologiques. Toutefois, en cas d’hyperoxalurie ou de suspicion d’HP, un génotypage n’était pas toujours prescrit. Les freins à cette prescription méritent d’être explorés.",

A practical ergonomic program was expected to improve their occupational health and musculoskeletal discomfort. This study developed an ergonomic training program with exercise and examined its effectiveness for musculoskeletal discomfort and muscle strength in hemodialysis nurses. A cluster pilot randomized control trial was conducted. Participant nurses were from two hemodialysis units at two medical centers in Taiwan in 2019 and 2020. A 12-week ergonomic program with exercise customized by the job analysis of hemodialysis nursing tasks applied to the intervention group (n = 14). A mobile messenger application was adopted to remind, monitor, and consult the implementation of exercises. The musculoskeletal discomfort degree and muscle strength were measured before and after training as well as the follow-up after another 12 weeks. The training effect between the intervention group and the control group (n = 20), was analyzed by the generalized estimating equations model. The significant improvements in muscle strength of the wrist and pinch power of the dominant hand were identified after training. The sustaining effect showed significant decreases in musculoskeletal discomfort degrees in the elbows, wrists\/hands, knees, and ankles\/feet. Training participants achieved an 80% adherence rate to the exercise program, facilitated by a convenient mobile messenger application. They also responded with very high satisfaction with all the ergonomic education, exercise regimen, and use of resistance devices. This trial approves the effectiveness of the developed program for hemodialysis nurses and its feasibility in clinical practice. This ergonomic training with a customized exercise program for hemodialysis nurses can serve as a valuable educational resource for hemodialysis nurses to mitigate work-related musculoskeletal disorders and improve occupational strength. Integrating the support of remote technology can enhance program adherence in hectic work environments.",

        "abstract":"Poor water treatments and concentrates to prepare dialysis fluids favor bacterial growth-producing pyrogens (e.g., endotoxins) that may cross hemodialysis, particularly high-flux, membranes. This puts hemodialysis patients at risk of acute bacteremia, pyrogenic reactions, long-term complications, loss of residual renal function, and poor nutritional status. Consequently, regulatory bodies worldwide recommend using ultrapure dialysis fluid for routine hemodialysis. Requests are also growing for the online production of sterile non-pyrogenic substitution fluid from ultrapure dialysis fluid. This way, large volumes of infusion solution may be safely and economically produced, enabling more end-stage kidney disease patients to benefit from the greater capacity of hemodiafiltration to remove toxins than purely diffusive hemodialysis treatment. Ultrapure dialysis and substitution fluids are often produced upstream from hemodialyzers by online filtration of standard dialysis fluid through cascades of bacteria- and endotoxin-retentive filters (ETRFs). Commercial ETRFs differ for membranes, operation, performance, duration and maintenance protocols, connection to a dialysis machine, disinfection procedures, and replacement schedule. Although suboptimal ETRF choice may increase treatment costs, the difficulty in gathering comparative information on commercial ETRFs complicates their selection. To aid dialysis centers in selecting the most convenient and suitable ETRF for their needs, herein, relevant characteristics of commercial ETRFs are reported and critically reviewed for a quick yet effective comparison.",

        "abstract":"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) significantly increases a patient's risk of long-term cognitive decline and is common in adults. However, few studies have evaluated patients with end-stage renal disease receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). In addition, the relationship between frailty and SCD in MHD patients remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the potential factors affecting SCD in MHD patients and to investigate the relationship between frailty and SCD. This was a cross-sectional study. From December 2023 to April 2024, via the convenience sampling method, a total of 171 patients from West China Hospital of Sichuan University were recruited to participate in this study. The demographic and sociological characteristics of the participants were assessed via a general information questionnaire. The subjective cognitive decline questionnaire 9 (SCD-Q9), the Tilburg frailty indicator (TFI), the subjective global nutritional assessment (SGA) and the grip dynamometer were used to assess the participants' subjective cognitive level, frailty, nutritional status, and grip strength, respectively. Univariate analyses were used to examine potential factors associated with SCD. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationships between these factors and SCD. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the association between SCD and frailty. The average subjective cognitive decline score of the 171 MHD patients was 4.00 (2.00-7.00), and 95 patients (55.56%) with scores > 3 presented with SCD. Linear regression analysis revealed that sex, work status, grip strength, SGA, and frailty were influential factors in MHD patients, explaining 38.80% of the total variation in SCD. Spearman's analysis revealed that SCD was positively correlated with frailty in MHD patients (r = 0.431, P < 0.001). The prevalence of SCD in MHD patients is common and correlates with certain patient characteristics, including sex, work status, grip strength, SGA, and frailty. Healthcare workers should pay attention to the assessment of subjective cognitive function in this population, remain aware of the risk factors for SCD, and take targeted interventions as early as possible, which can help improve the quality of survival and slow the occurrence of cognitive impairment.",

Regarding patient activation, those belonging to higher activation groups were less likely to have low physical HRQOL compared with those belonging to lower activation groups (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.96 for medium; adjusted OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.70 for high; adjusted OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.61 for the highest activation group).

        "abstract":"A female senior dialysis patient was found dead in her apartment, covered in blood. Bloodstains were observed in different rooms of the apartment. During the post-mortem examination on site, a small, roundish opening of the skin was observed on the flexor side of the upper arm, within a longitudinal scar, from which blood was draining. Throughout police investigation, the possibility of an accident, a suicidal act, or medical malpractice during dialysis care was considered. An autopsy was ordered for further clarification. The autopsy identified exsanguination from a fistula on the flexor side of the left upper arm as the cause of death. The fistula could be traced into an arteriovenous shunt vessel that had been created a long time ago for dialysis. Upon projection onto the shunt vessel, punctiform crusts with underlying hemorrhages in the subcutaneous fatty tissue were identified in the skin. Histological examinations of the fistula and its surrounding tissue revealed no evidence of vasculitis or perivascular inflammatory changes, but puncture sites of varying ages with connective tissue texture disruption of the vessel wall and the adjacent subcutaneous tissue. Forensic medical examination concluded that death was caused by bleeding from an arteriovenous dialysis shunt vessel as a complication of hemodialysis. This case illustrates the relevance of comprehensive forensic medical case processing as the basis for a well-founded assessment.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of physical exercise on quality of life, physical function, pain, energy, sleep, and malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome in PD patients. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared routine care with physical activity interventions in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing PD. The search covered studies from database inception to December 2023. Outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) with standard deviations (SD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.3. We included nine RCTs involving 398 patients, with 199 (50%) randomized to the physical activity group. Follow-up ranged from 12 weeks to 6 months. Compared to routine care, the exercise group showed significant improvements in BKD (MD 9.98; 95% CI 2.14-17.82; p = 0.01), EKD (MD 7.15; 95% CI - 0.13-14.43; p = 0.05), social support (MD 9.51; 95% CI 0.27-18.75; p = 0.04), social interaction (MD 6.91; 95% CI 0.82-13.00; p = 0.03), and physical pain (MD 14.35; 95% CI 3.60-25.10; p = 0.009). Qualitative analysis revealed a significant decrease in homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), a significant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), and improvements in sitting and standing tests (CS-30, FTTST, SS5) in the exercise group (p < 0.05). This study represents the first meta-analysis comparing usual care with exercise interventions in PD patients. The findings indicate that exercise is a viable therapeutic option.

Here we investigate associations between HLA polymorphism and serological and T-lymphocyte responses to the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines within a population receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD) for End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Our primary objective was to identify HLA alleles associated with diminished serological and T-cellular responsiveness to vaccination. As a secondary objective, the associations between HLA type and COVID-19 disease outcomes were investigated using an independent ESRD cohort (n = 327). This aimed to determine if the alleles associated with poor vaccine response were also linked to unfavourable infection outcomes. In the main study, serum from 225 SARS-CoV-2 infection-naïve patients was HLA-typed using high-resolution Next Generation Sequencing, and serological titres were analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-specific antibodies after two doses of vaccination. A subset of patients (n = 33) was also tested for a T-lymphocyte response. Overall, 89% (n = 200) of patients seroconverted, but only 18% (n = 6) of the cellular response subgroup had a positive T-lymphocyte response. The HLA class II alleles DPB1*104:01, DRB1*04:03 and DRB1*14:04 and HLA class I alleles B*08:01 and B*18:01 were found to significantly correlate with seronegativity, and DQB1*06:01 correlated with serological responsiveness. We were unable to analyse the effect of HLA on disease outcome and T-lymphocyte response due to sample size limitations. Our results suggest pathways for further research and begin to elucidate the relationship between HLA polymorphism and immune responses in the vulnerable ESRD population.",

A post-AKI outcomes prediction model is important for the early detection of important clinical outcomes associated with AKI so that early management of pediatric AKI patients can be initiated. Three retrospective cohorts were set up based on two pediatric hospitals in China, in which 8205 children suffered AKI during hospitalization. Two clinical outcomes were evaluated, i.e. hospital mortality and dialysis within 28 days after AKI occurrence. A Genetic Algorithm was used for feature selection, and a Random Forest model was built to predict clinical outcomes. Subsequently, a temporal validation set and an external validation set were used to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. Finally, the stratification ability of the prediction model for the risk of mortality was compared with a commonly used mortality risk score, the pediatric critical illness score (PCIS). The prediction model performed well for the prediction of hospital mortality with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.854 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.816-0.888], and the AUROC was >0.850 for both temporal and external validation.

This report describes a 72-year-old male with ESRD of unknown etiology who was assessed for a deceased donor kidney transplant. Severe atherosclerosis of the iliac arteries was identified on preoperative imaging, leading to the selection of the inferior epigastric artery (IEA) as the vascular conduit. Anastomosis was performed using interrupted 6-0 prolene sutures, resulting in successful graft reperfusion without intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient experienced delayed graft function (DGF), remaining anuric for 10 days and requiring multiple hemodialysis sessions as well as antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy. Urine output resumed on the 10th postoperative day, and the patient was discharged two weeks after surgery. Despite initial challenges, including DGF requiring temporary dialysis, the patient achieved full recovery with stable graft function confirmed at follow-up. One-month follow-up with CT angiography confirmed satisfactory graft perfusion. This case underscores the feasibility of utilizing the IEA as an alternative vascular access in complex kidney transplantation, highlighting the critical importance of preoperative imaging, surgical adaptability, and the ongoing challenges of limited graft availability and long waiting times for transplant candidates.",

        "abstract":"Background and objectives Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue affecting millions of people worldwide. The role of caregivers in the management of CKD patients on dialysis cannot be overstated. This study investigates the quality of life among caregivers of patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) for CKD at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It aims to assess the quality of life and prevalence of depression among caregivers in each dialysis modality. By recognizing significant differences in caregiving experiences between HD and PD, this research seeks to enhance understanding of caregiver burdens and overall quality of life. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at King Khalid University Hospital and included 80 Saudi adult caregivers of CKD patients on HD or PD receiving treatment at the dialysis center in February 2023. Caregivers were recruited through phone surveys. Participants were required to be over 15 years old, free from psychiatric illnesses, co-residing with the patient, and providing care for at least one month. Results Among the 80 caregivers, 49 (61.25%) were female. A statistically significant gender distribution was observed between groups, with a higher proportion of females among PD caregivers (31 (73.81%)) compared to HD caregivers (18 (47.37%); p=0.015). The mean age of caregivers was 41.41 years (SD=12.82). Regarding education, 55 (68.75%) caregivers had a university degree or higher, with a significantly greater proportion among PD caregivers (34 (80.95%)) than HD caregivers (21 (55.26%); p=0.047). Depression assessments showed that 54 (67.5%) caregivers experienced minimal depression, with no significant difference between groups. However, caregivers of PD patients reported lower levels of burden, with 25 (59.5%) experiencing no to mild burden compared to 14 (36.8%) of HD caregivers, showing a trend toward significance (p=0.053). Additionally, a larger proportion of PD caregivers (30 (71.43%)) were involved in long-term care (>24 months) compared to HD caregivers (17 (44.74%)), suggesting a potentially more sustainable caregiving role (p=0.057). Conclusion This study indicates that the quality of life for PD caregivers is generally better than that for HD caregivers, primarily due to the lower burden and higher educational level among PD caregivers. The in-center nature and frequent treatment schedule associated with HD may lead to higher levels of burden. Addressing the specific needs of caregivers based on dialysis modality can improve quality of life and enhance CKD management strategies, ultimately benefiting both patients and caregivers.",

Glomerulonephritis (GN) in AAV, ANCA-GN, not only dictates therapeutic decisions but is also of relevance for overall survival influencing the risk of cardiovascular disease and serious infections. A diagnosis of ANCA-GN includes laboratory investigations including urinalysis and a thorough assessment of potential organ involvement. A kidney biopsy can be performed to ascertain the diagnosis but has an additional prognostic relevance and tools have been established to predict long-term kidney survival. Experimental biomarkers indicating kidney inflammation include urinary soluble CD163 and the presence of urinary T cells. Therapeutic options are refined and some of these therapies, such as the added value of performing plasma exchange, are the matter of controversial discussions. Safe reduction of cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids and eventually the use of avacopan to substantially reduce glucocorticoid exposure has been implemented in most centers. In the remission of maintenance, the optimal duration of therapy is still unclear, but extended use of rituximab as maintenance agent has shown long-term remission rates, thus limiting the damage accrued by relapsing disease and thus also reducing the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Avacopan has been the first agent with a glomerular filtration rate-sparing effect, likely due to more rapid control of kidney inflammation. Those reaching ESKD should be evaluated for kidney transplantation and the risk of remaining on dialysis must be balanced against the risk of recurrence of disease following transplantation. The advent of a magnitude of landmark studies in ANCA-GN has refined diagnostic approaches, implemented tools to predict kidney outcome, and eventually led to the approval of newer therapies with avacopan, the latest addition to the armamentarium. Once ESKD is present, patients should be considered for kidney transplantation as remaining on dialysis portends poor overall prognosis.",

Although kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred therapy for eligible candidates, individuals in rural areas face challenges accessing specialized medical services due to longer travel distances. Limited understanding exists regarding patients' perspectives on returning to work after KT and whether this correlates with their urbanization status, potentially influencing outcomes. Retrospective, nationwide (Swiss Transplant Cohort Study [STCS]) study, from May 2008 to 2020, including 1926 patients aged 18 to 60 years who underwent KT. We investigated the self-reported work reintegration at 1, 3, and 5 years after the KT, the recipient and allograft survival, and the allograft function at 12 months, contingent on urbanization status (urban, suburban, rural). The return rate of sufficiently filled-in questionnaires was 81% (1053 participants). Urban recipients were younger, had longer dialysis time before KT, and had less living donor KT. At baseline, the level of education, as well as the workforce defined as work capacity > 50%, were lower in urban areas (37% urban, 39% suburban, and 47% rural). Regression analysis revealed significantly higher odds ratio for employment 1 year post-KT among patients residing in rural and suburban areas (odds ratio: 1.31 [confidence interval: 1.04-1.65] and 1.52 [confidence interval: 1.16-1.98], respectively) compared to patients from urban regions. Stratified according to urbanization environment, recipient and allograft survival were comparable across groups. Patient and graft outcomes were favorable, with improved work reintegration observed at the 1-year mark post-KT for recipients from rural backgrounds compared to those from suburban and urban areas.",

        "abstract":"Pathophysiology of kidney diseases frequently implies sterile inflammation, e.g. during glomerulonephritis or after renal transplantation. Recently, the relevance of systemic low-grade inflammation for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and complications of CKD have come into focus. In this review article, the etiology, and consequences of low-grade inflammation in CKD patients are discussed. Further, the potential of anti-inflammatory approaches to slow down CKD progression is addressed. Recent advances have resulted in FDA approval of colchicine for patients with preserved renal function and atherosclerosis. Thus, lastly, anti-inflammatory therapy of atherosclerosis in patients with or without CKD is outlined.Taken together, anti-inflammatory therapy offers novel opportunities to improve CKD progression, inhibit transition from acute to chronic kidney disease and reduce the risk of fatal long-term complications such as cardiovascular disease. Während Nierenerkrankungen, die mit akuter nicht infektiöser Entzündung einhergehen, wie bspw. Glomerulonephritiden, bereits seit Jahrzehnten erfolgreich primär antiinflammatorisch behandelt werden, ist die Low-Grade-Inflammation in der Nephrologie bisher noch wenig beachtet.Nun rückt jedoch die pathophysiologische Bedeutung der chronischen systemischen Low-Grade-Inflammation für die Progression der chronischen Nierenerkrankung (CKD) und die damit verbundenen kardiovaskulären Komplikationen in den Vordergrund.Antiinflammatorische Strategien haben in klinischen Studien bereits eine Effektivität in der Sekundär- und Tertiärprävention kardiovaskulärer Ereignisse gezeigt. Aktuelle Veröffentlichungen demonstrieren, dass eine Adressierung der Low-Grade-Inflammation mittels Inhibition der Interleukin-1- und Interleukin-6-Signalwege auch bei CKD-Patienten vorteilhafte Effekte auf die renale Anämie, die Progression der Nierenerkrankung sowie auf Komplikationsraten hat, ein todesursachenunabhängiger Mortalitätsvorteil zeigte sich jedoch bisher nicht.",

        "abstract":"A comprehensive review of known uremic retention molecules goes back to more than 10 years ago and did not consider metabolomic analyses. The present analysis searches for as of yet unclassified solutes retained in chronic kidney disease (CKD) by analyzing metabolites associated with relevant outcomes of CKD. This untargeted metabolomics-based approach is compared with a conventional targeted literature search. For the selected molecules, the literature was screened for arguments regarding toxic (harmful), beneficial, or neutral effects in experimental or clinical studies. Findings were independently crosschecked. In total, 103 molecules were selected. No literature on any effect was found for 55 substances, 3 molecules had no significant effect, and 13 others showed beneficial effects. For the remaining 32 compounds, we found at least one report of a toxic effect. Whereas 62.5% of the compounds with at least one study on a toxic effect was retrieved via the bottom-up approach, 69.2% of the substances originating from metabolomics-based approaches showed a beneficial effect. Our results suggest that untargeted metabolomics offer a more balanced view of uremic retention than the targeted approaches, with higher chances of revealing the beneficial potential of some of the metabolites.",

        "abstract":"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with heightened risk of thrombosis. Prescription of anticoagulants is key to manage it; however, CKD patients have shown an increased risk of bleeding under anticoagulation therapy compared to non-CKD patients. We hypothesized that the sex could modify the metabolism of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin and Apixaban. Our intoxication model shows that higher doses of IS and apixaban accumulate in the plasma of female mice because of expression differences in efflux transporters and cytochromes in the liver, ileum and kidneys, when compared to males. Furthermore, we found that accumulation of apixaban in females contributes to increased bleeding. Transcriptional analysis of liver samples revealed elevated Sult1a1 but reduced Abcg2 and Cyp3a11 in female mice, while in the kidneys the expression rates of Oat1 and Oat3 were respectively lower and higher than those observed in males, potentially affecting drug clearance. Whole proteomics liver analysis confirmed the previous transcriptional results at the protein level and revealed that sex had a major influence in regulating both coagulation and drug metabolism pathways. Thus, our findings underline the need for inclusive clinical and preclinical trials to accurately reflect sex-specific metabolic variations, and to consider CKD-specific changes to optimize dosing, minimize side effects, and improve patient outcomes.",

The completeness of 24-h urinary collection is assessed by urinary creatinine excretion, which reflects the muscle mass. Hence, it is of paramount importance to define expected values of daily urinary creatinine excretion to correctly interpret urinary collection. These references are available for the general population. We hypothesized that these reference values might not be applicable to individuals with obesity whose body composition is different from general population. Our objective was to define daily urinary creatinine excretion among population with obesity. We conducted a monocentric, retrospective, observational study, including adult patients (≥18 y) admitted for measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Measurement of GFR requires timed urinary collections to calculate the urinary clearance of the tracer. We took advantage of timed urinary collection to calculate in-hospital urinary creatinine flow rate and to extrapolate it to 24 h (exUCreat We included 1091 patients [median age 56 y, interquartile range (44, 67); 62.7% males] with nondialysis CKD stages 1-5.

        "abstract":"Depression is highly prevalent during chronic kidney disease (CKD) with studies suggesting prevalence rates ranging from approximately one-quarter to half of CKD patients. CKD and depression have a bidirectional relationship, each disorder aggravating the other, leading to more complex and challenging patient management. Depression during CKD is multifactorial and is associated with increased risk of adverse events and hospitalization. We conducted a narrative review of experimental and observational studies in animals and humans, as well as meta-analyses, to explore specific mechanisms of depression in CKD and its treatment. In depression the gut-brain axis is central. CKD leads to an accumulation of gut-derived uremic toxins. One key factor is the accumulation of tryptophan-derived uremic toxins like kynurenines or indoxyl sulfate, whose serum concentration increases progressively with the stage of CKD (up to 100-fold in stage 5), and which plays an important role in depression mechanisms, by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor, decreasing brain concentrations of serotonin by approximately 40 %, increasing brain inflammation, via activation of microglia and astrocytes and release of TNFα, IL-6 and NO. Randomized controlled studies found limited or no benefits of antidepressants for depressive symptoms in CKD and hemodialysis patients. Chronic inflammation, in relation to uremic toxin accumulation during CKD, seems to be a complex but important mechanism for treatment resistance in depression. Future research should consider inhibitors of uremic toxins inhibitors and anti-inflammatory molecules as potential therapeutic agents, to improve the prognosis of depression in CKD patients.",

We compared the risks of the different reasons for transfer to HD in PD patients according to the use of assistance for PD care, PD modality, and the suboptimal starter status. This was a retrospective study using data from the French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry from patients who started PD between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018. We used Cox and Fine Gray survival models to evaluate the risks of transfer to HD due to PD inadequacy, infection, mechanical issue, psychosocial issue, others PD-related and others non-PD-related causes. Models were evaluated for three periods of PD vintage: 0 to 6 months, 6 to 18 months, and after 18 months. The study included 15,974 incident PD patients treated in 170 French PD units. There were 6,835 deaths, 5,108 transfers to HD and 3,092 renal transplantations. Nurse-assisted PD was associated with a lower risk of transfer to HD for infection in the first 18 months (cs-HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.31-0.83 before 6 months) and for adequacy issues after 6 months (cs-HR 0.59, 95%CI 0.51-0.70 after 18 months). The risk of transfer for mechanical issue was higher in CAPD compared to APD during the first eighteen months (cs-HR 1.41, 95%CI 1.00-1.99 before 6 months), but CAPD was associated with a lower risk for adequacy, infectious or mechanical issue after 18 months. Finally, suboptimal starters have a higher risk of transfer due to psychosocial challenges in the first 6 months (cs-HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.03-2.81). Distinct factors are associated with the risk of transfer from PD to in-center HD, according to the cause of the transfer.

Having a kidney disease negatively affects a woman's reproductive health, making infertility a significant concern, and women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly seeking treatment with assisted reproductive technology. The side effects of assisted reproductive technology are not fully known and its impact on kidney function, especially if a woman has undergone repeated treatments, is likewise not known. This case series gathers all consecutive patients who were followed by the Mansoura University Hospital's Obstetric Nephrology Service or were admitted to its Nephrology and Gynecology Department during pregnancy with a diagnosis of acute or chronic kidney function impairment after conceiving with an assisted reproductive technology method, in the period from 2021 to 2024. Of the approximately 150 pregnancies referred to the Obstetric Nephrology Clinic, 6 were referred for acute or acute-on-chronic kidney function impairment, or nephrotic syndrome after conceiving via assisted reproductive technology. In one patient, CKD was overlooked and later progressed to kidney failure; one had probable CKD, but discontinued follow-up before confirmation; and one had a kidney malformation, diagnosed during pregnancy. All presented with early or very early severe hypertension and proteinuria, before 20 weeks, while preeclampsia and the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are conventionally defined as developing after 20 weeks of gestation. Three had complete recovery postpartum, one progressed to kidney failure, while two were lost to follow-up. Severe early-pregnancy kidney impairment after assisted reproductive technology is probably more frequent than previously reported. Assessment of kidney function after assisted reproductive technology should be mandatory, to make it possible for timely specialized kidney care to be given.",

The data being rare in the ivorian context, this study aims to describe these defects' epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary aspects in children in a reference hospital setting. We performed a retrospective and descriptive study held in the Yopougon's Teaching Hospital Pediatric Nephrology Unit from December 1st 2008 to December 31st 2020. It involved 152 children aged 0 to 15 years, admitted to the unit, with a congenital anomaly of the kidney and the urinary tract diagnosed with radiology. Socio-demographic characteristics: congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract's prevalence was 11%. The median age at admission was 36 months. The median age at diagnosis of malformative uropathy was 17.5 months. The sex ratio (M\/F) was 2.3. Clinical characteristics: posterior urethra valves were the most common malformative uropathy (38%). Malformative uropathy was associated with other defects in 4% of cases. The antenatal diagnosis involved 24% of patients. The average gestational age of discovery was 32 weeks of amenorrhea. In the postnatal period, abdominal pain was the main circumstance for discovery (39%). Therapeutic characteristics: surgery was indicated in 58% of patients and performed in 64% of cases. Evolutionary characteristics: evolution was better in patients who had received surgical treatment (asymptomatic in 83% of cases, occurrence of urinary tract infection in 35% of cases and chronic renal failure in 23% of cases). 72% of the study population was lost. In Côte d'Ivoire, malformatives uropathies are late-discovered and are dominated by posterior urethra valves. Knowledge and management of these renal and urinary tract defects deserve to be improved through the development of antenatal diagnosis and training of practitioners in early recognition of clinical signs. The high rate of lost patients must be reduced by the implementation of an active patients' follow-up system.

Caractéristiques socio-démographiques : la prévalence des uropathies malformatives était de 11 %. L’âge médian à l’admission était de 36 mois. L’âge médian au diagnostic d’uropathie malformative était de 17,5 mois. Le sex-ratio (H\/F) était de 2,3. Caractéristiques cliniques : les valves de l’urètre postérieur représentaient l’uropathie malformative la plus fréquente (38 %). L’uropathie malformative était associée à d’autres malformations dans 4 % des cas. Le diagnostic anténatal concernait 24 % des patients. L’âge gestationnel moyen de découverte était de 32 semaines d’aménorrhée. En période postnatale, la douleur abdominale était la principale circonstance de découverte (39 %). Caractéristiques thérapeutiques : l’intervention chirurgicale était indiquée chez 58 % des patients et réalisée dans 64 % des cas. Caractéristiques évolutives : l’évolution était meilleure chez les patients opérés (asymptomatiques dans 83 % des cas, survenue d’une infection urinaire dans 35 % des cas et d’une insuffisance rénale chronique dans 23 % des cas). 72 % de la population d’étude a été perdue de vue. En Côte d’Ivoire, les uropathies malformatives sont de découverte tardive et sont dominées par les valves de l’urètre postérieur. La connaissance et la prise en charge de ces malformations méritent d’être améliorées par le développement du diagnostic anténatal et la formation des praticiens à la reconnaissance précoce des signes d’appels cliniques. Le taux important de perdus de vue doit être réduit par la mise en place d’un système actif de suivi des patients.",

        "abstract":"A harmonized medical nomenclature that is accessible to the lay people is crucial to raising awareness of insidious health problems such as chronic kidney disease and facilitating communication between healthcare professionals. This article presents the proposals of a French-speaking working group for the translation and adaptation into French of the nomenclature for renal function and disease that resulted from a KDIGO consensus conference published in English in 2020. In particular, the working group recommends abandoning terms that used to correspond in French to “chronic renal failure”, “acute renal failure”, “end-stage renal failure”, “uremia”, “cadaveric donor” and “microalbuminuria”, in favor of French equivalents of “chronic renal disease”, “acute kidney injury”, “renal failure”, “uremic syndrome”, “deceased donor” and “albuminuria”. Arguments against the former and in favor of the latter are presented. Other equivalents of English terms from the KDIGO nomenclature are presented in a Table, and an Appendix presents equivalents proposed in German and Spanish by other authors. We hope that our proposals will be well received by healthcare professionals as well as by their patients and the public. Une nomenclature médicale harmonisée et à la portée du grand public est cruciale pour mieux faire connaître des problèmes de santé insidieux, comme la maladie rénale chronique, et faciliter la communication entre professionnels de la santé. Cet article présente les propositions d’un groupe de travail francophone pour la traduction et l’adaptation en français de la nomenclature de la fonction et des maladies rénales issue d’une conférence de consensus KDIGO, publiée en anglais, en 2020. Le groupe de travail recommande notamment l’abandon des termes « insuffisance rénale chronique », « insuffisance rénale aiguë », « insuffisance rénale terminale », « urémie », « donneur cadavérique » et « micro-albuminurie », au profit de ceux de « maladie rénale chronique », « atteinte rénale aiguë », « défaillance rénale », « syndrome urémique », « donneur décédé » et « albuminurie » (tableau 1). Des arguments en défaveur des premiers et en faveur des seconds sont présentés. D’autres équivalents de termes anglais de la nomenclature KDIGO sont présentés dans le tableau 2, et l’annexe 1 reprend les équivalents proposés en allemand et en espagnol par d’autres auteurs. Nous espérons que nos propositions seront bien accueillies par les professionnels de santé ainsi que par leurs patients et le grand public.",

        "abstract":"Renal involvement in ANCA vasculitides (AAV) is frequent and often severe, leading to end-stage kidney disease either immediately, in the follow-up or after episodes of relapses. Renal involvement is associated with other organ involvement in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (PAM), but may also be isolated in vasculitis limited to the kidney. It is less common in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GEPA). The classical clinical presentation is one of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, associated with the presence of PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA. Kidney biopsy (showing pauci-immune extra-capillary glomerulonephritis) is not essential for the diagnosis of VAA, but it does have a prognostic value, can rule out other causes of glomerulonephritis (especially in renal-limited forms of AAV) and can help for the decision of plasma exchange use. Treatment of AAV with renal involvement is based on a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants (rituximab or cyclophosphamide). Avacopan may also be proposed as a cortisone-sparing treatment. This review sets out the various recommended therapeutic protocols and their scope of application. The role of plasma exchange is also discussed. L’atteinte rénale des vascularites à ANCA (VAA) est fréquente, souvent sévère, pouvant conduire à l’insuffisance rénale chronique terminale d’emblée, lors du suivi ou à l’occasion d’une rechute. L’atteinte rénale est souvent associée à d’autres atteintes d’organe au cours de la granulomatose avec polyangéite (GPA) ou la polyangéite microscopique (PAM), mais peut aussi être isolée (vascularite limitée au rein). Elle est plus rare au cours de la granulomatose éosinophilique avec polyangéite (GEPA). Le tableau biologique classique est celui d’une glomérulonéphrite rapidement progressive, associée à la présence d’ANCA de spécificité anti-PR3 ou anti-MPO. La biopsie rénale (montrant une glomérulonéphrite extra-capillaire pauci-immune) n’est pas indispensable au diagnostic de VAA mais elle a une valeur pronostique, élimine les diagnostics alternatifs (en particulier dans les formes rénales isolées) et peut aider à la décision de réaliser des échanges plasmatiques. Le traitement des VAA avec atteinte rénale repose sur l’association de corticoïdes et d’immunosuppresseurs (rituximab ou cyclophosphamide). L’avacopan peut également être proposé, à visée d’épargne cortisonique. Cette revue précise les différents protocoles thérapeutiques recommandés et leurs cadres d’application.

        "abstract":"Sleep disorders are common in all stages of chronic kidney disease and significantly affect the quality of life of these patients. The main causes of sleep disorders are pruritus, depression, restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. To date, there is no defined strategy or expert consensus for the screening of sleep disorders in this population, nor any recommendation on a specific management strategy according to etiology. We propose to use the PROMIS-29 questionnaire, to which two questions have been added: “Do you scratch yourself? Do you snore?” The answers to these questions, together with the scores for the “Sleep disorders” (score ≥ 12), “Depression” (score ≥ 11), “Pain” (score ≥ 11) and “Fatigue” (score ≥ 14) domains make it possible to screen for sleep disorders, specify their etiology and refer patients for appropriate management. We suggest a standardized management strategy for each major orientation. This pathway, to be adapted according to the resources of each center, should lead to the diagnosis of more patients suffering from sleep disorders and improve their quality of life. Les troubles du sommeil sont fréquents à tous les stades de la maladie rénale chronique et affectent considérablement la qualité de vie des patients. Les principales causes de ces troubles sont le prurit, la dépression, le syndrome des jambes sans repos et le syndrome d’apnée hypopnée obstructive du sommeil. À ce jour, il n’existe ni stratégie définie, ni consensus d’experts pour le dépistage des troubles du sommeil dans cette population, ni de recommandations spécifiques pour leur prise en charge en fonction de l’étiologie. Nous proposons, après une revue de la littérature, un chemin clinique basé sur le questionnaire de qualité de vie PROMIS-29 auquel deux questions ont été ajoutées « Est-ce que vous vous grattez ? Est-ce que vous ronflez ? ». La réponse à ces questions ainsi que les scores pour les domaines « Troubles du sommeil » (score ≥ 12), « Dépression » (score ≥ 11), « Douleur » (score ≥ 11) et « Fatigue » (score ≥ 14) permettent de dépister les troubles du sommeil, de préciser leur étiologie et d’orienter les patients vers une prise en charge adaptée. Nous suggérons une stratégie standardisée pour la prise en charge selon chaque grande orientation. Ce chemin, à adapter selon les ressources de chaque centre, devrait permettre de diagnostiquer plus de patients souffrant de troubles du sommeil et d’améliorer leur qualité de vie.",

        "abstract":"HUS induced by shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC HUS) is a serious disease requiring dialysis in 50% of cases, but renal recovery is frequent. Renal sequelae such as proteinuria, arterial hypertension (AH) and chronic renal failure (CRF) are possible in 30% of cases. Several prognostic factors have been identified, the main one being the duration of anuria. The aim of our paper is to describe the outcome of typical HUS in a cohort of patients followed over three years, and to detect reliable early predictors of poor prognosis in a specialized department in Algeria. Our study is observational and longitudinal. Inclusion criteria were the triad anemia-thrombocytopenia-acute renal failure (ARF) in children under sixteen years of age. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively at baseline, at three months and every six months. A cohort of 23 children was recruited. The rate of recovery of renal function and death was 83% and 13%, respectively. There is a significant correlation between the presence of neurological damage, young age < 2 years and the occurrence of kidney damage. Late dialysis > 48 hours multiplies the relative risk of kidney damage by four. Event-free survival (death or occurrence of proteinuria, hypertension and\/or CKD) is significantly related to young age and the time to dialysis > 48 hours. Delayed dialysis has a significant impact on overall survival. The latter factor increases the risk of death. Early diagnosis and management are important prognostic factors. Nephrological follow-up of all children with HUS is necessary in order to detect progression to CKD. Le syndrome hémolytique et urémique induit par l’Escherichia coli, productrice de shigatoxine (SHU STEC) est une maladie grave qui nécessite la dialyse dans 50 % des cas. Malgré une fréquence de récupération rénale élevée, des séquelles à type de protéinurie, d’hypertension artérielle (HTA) et d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) sont possibles dans 30 % des cas. Plusieurs facteurs pronostiques ont été identifiés, la durée de l’anurie en est le principal. Le but de notre article est de décrire le devenir du SHU typique dans une cohorte de patients suivis sur une durée de trois ans et de détecter les prédicteurs précoces fiables de mauvais pronostic dans un service spécialisé en Algérie. Notre étude est observationnelle et longitudinale. Les critères d’inclusion étaient : la triade anémie-thrombopénie-insuffisance rénale aiguë (IRA) chez les enfants de moins de seize ans. Un recueil des caractéristiques cliniques et biologiques initiales, à trois mois et tous les six mois, a été effectué prospectivement. Une cohorte de 23 enfants a été recrutée. Le taux de récupération de la fonction rénale et de décès était respectivement de 83 % et de 13 %. La corrélation est significative entre la présence d’une atteinte neurologique, le jeune âge < 2 ans et la survenue de lésions rénales. La dialyse tardive > 48 heures multiplie le risque relatif d’atteinte rénale par quatre. La survie sans événement (décès ou survenue d’une protéinurie, HTA et\/ou IRC) est liée significativement au jeune âge et au délai de dialyse > 48 heures. Le retard de dialyse retentit de manière significative sur la survie globale. Ce dernier facteur augmente le risque de décès. Le diagnostic et la prise en charge précoces sont des facteurs pronostiques importants. Le suivi néphrologique de tous les enfants atteints de SHU est nécessaire, afin de dépister une évolution vers l’IRC.",

        "abstract":"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most prevalent renal cancer subtype, is frequently associated with poor prognosis. RHO-GTPase signaling genes have been implicated in tumor aggressiveness and unfavorable survival, but their potential in risk stratification and therapeutic guidance for ccRCC patients remains unexplored. Univariate regression identified prognostically relevant RHO-GTPase signaling genes, followed by consensus clustering for ccRCC subtype classification. LASSO regression selected key genes to construct a six-gene risk model. The model was evaluated for prognostic stratification, immune status, immunotherapy response, and chemotherapy sensitivity. Key genes were analyzed at the genomic, single-cell, and protein levels to explore underlying mechanisms. Among 62 prognostically relevant RHO-GTPase signaling genes, six (ARHGAP11B, NUF2, PLK1, CYFIP2, IQGAP2, and VAV3) were identified to form a robust prognostic signature. This model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with high-risk patients demonstrating significantly worse outcomes. The model exhibited excellent predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.7 in training and validation cohorts). High-risk patients were characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced sensitivity to immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis revealed 107 agents correlated with the risk score, underscoring therapeutic relevance. Mechanistically, the six key genes showed distinct expression patterns, cellular distribution, and positive correlation with VHL mutations, highlighting their potential as actionable drug targets. This study established a novel six-gene RHO-GTPase signaling model for predicting prognosis, immune status, and therapeutic responses in ccRCC, which offers potential for improving patient stratification and guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

        "abstract":"Recent studies indicate that cell-derived exosomes are effective in treating diabetic renal injury, though their precise mechanisms remain unclear. This meta-analysis evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in diabetic nephropathy. In addition to reviewing references and consulting experts, we systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for studies on exosome therapy for diabetic nephropathy. Seven outcome measures were selected to evaluate efficacy: blood glucose [(fasting blood glucose (FBG) and random blood glucose (RBG)], renal function parameters [serum creatinine (SCR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 24-hour urinary protein (24 h UP) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)], and inflammatory factors. Study quality was assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool, and data were analyzed using RevMan (version 5.3) software. We included 17 studies involving 288 animals, with follow-up durations ranging from 2 to 14 weeks. Pooled analysis demonstrated that exosome treatment significantly improved GLU (FBG: SMD - 1.39, 95% CI -2.70 to -0.08, P = 0.04; RBG: SMD - 1.29, 95% CI -2.25 to -0.34, P < 0.008), SCR (SMD - 1.45, 95% CI -2.14 to -0.76, P < 0.0001), BUN (SMD - 2.06, 95% CI -3.01 to -1.11, P < 0.0001), 24 UP (SMD - 2.88, 95% CI -3.97 to -1.78, P < 0.00001), and UACR (SMD - 2.00, 95% CI -3.15 to -0.85, P = 0.0007) compared to the diabetic model group. Qualitative analysis revealed that exosomes increased anti-inflammatory factors while reducing pro-inflammatory factors (P < 0.05). No adverse effects of exosomes were reported in any of the included studies. Current evidence indicates that exosomes attenuate diabetic nephropathy progression through anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic, and autophagy-inducing mechanisms. To demonstrate the most efficient exosomes and therapeutic parameters for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy, future studies should conduct sizable, randomized, double-blind trials with high-quality, long-term follow-ups.",

We present the case of a 16-year-old male with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who developed tacrolimus toxicity after initiation of Paxlovid therapy. The ritonavir component strongly inhibits CYP3A4 enzymes, thereby leading to the accumulation of tacrolimus in the blood. This patient's toxicity manifested in multiorgan dysfunction including elevated creatinine, gastrointestinal distress, and arm tremors. By stopping tacrolimus and Paxlovid, tacrolimus levels decreased by 47%. Phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer with some prior use for tacrolimus toxicity in case reports, was utilized to further decrease tacrolimus levels because of worsening renal dysfunction. This yielded uncertain results but did not cause other adverse effects. Prescribers must exercise heightened awareness of drug-drug interactions when treating patients on tacrolimus with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as Paxlovid.",

        "abstract":"Recent studies indicate that tenapanor, an inhibitor of sodium\/proton exchanger-3 (NHE3), diminishes intestinal phosphorus (Pi) absorption. Given NHE3's pivotal role in sodium (Na+) metabolism, there is a suspected functional link between Na+ and Pi metabolism. High-salt diets (HSD) have been demonstrated to disrupt calcium (Ca2+) metabolism. Since Ca2+ and Pi share analogous metabolic pathways, it is yet to be determined whether HSD also impacts Pi metabolism. Male C57 mice were randomly assigned to three groups: a standard diet group, HSD groups for 1 week (HSD-1w) and 4 weeks (HSD-4w). Throughout the study, dietary intake and water consumption were monitored using metabolic cages, and urine and feces were collected. Blood pressure was measured using a noninvasive tail vein sphygmomanometer. Upon completion of the intervention, mice were euthanized under anesthesia for blood collection, and intestinal and renal tissues were harvested for molecular analysis. Although plasma Pi levels were comparable between HSD groups and the control group, HSD groups exhibited increased urinary Pi excretion and decreased fecal Pi excretion. The HSD-4w group displayed elevated parathyroid hormone levels, reduced fibroblast growth factor 23 levels, and higher renal Cyp27b1 mRNA expression. The expression of sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2b (Npt2b) and NHE3 was elevated in the intestine of HSD mice. HSD disrupts Pi metabolism by enhancing urinary Pi excretion and altering hormonal levels. The decrease in fecal Pi excretion, coupled with the upregulation of intestinal Pi transporter expression, suggests that HSD promotes intestinal Pi absorption in mice.",

        "abstract":"(1) Background: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the innate immunity of the mouth, particularly the mechanisms through which vitamin D influences oral health. Researchers have increasingly focused on the association between vitamin D and the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 since the CAMP gene, responsible for encoding the LL-37 peptide, is a direct target of both vitamin D and its receptor (vitamin D receptor, VDR). This study aimed to explore the correlation between the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and the concentration of the LL-37 peptide in both serum and saliva. The objective was to compare the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and ll-37 with those in saliva and to access the correlations between the two compounds. (2) Methods: Serum and whole saliva samples were collected from 72 healthy adults (mean age 28.68 ± 8.35). The levels of 25(OH)D and LL-37 were assessed in both the saliva and serum samples using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. (3) Results: The 25(OH)D levels in the serum (median 5.92 ng\/mL, min-max 2.7-10.4 ng\/mL) correlated with the LL-37 serum levels (62 ng\/mL, min-max 18-378 ng\/mL; Pearson's r 0.328, ",

        "abstract":"Chondrosarcomas are common bone sarcomas frequently resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, with high recurrence rates, development of metastatic disease, and death. Fibrosarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas associated with poor outcomes. Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane receptor 20 (TOMM20) is a mitochondrial receptor protein associated with cancer aggressiveness in many cancer subtypes, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the effects of TOMM20 overexpression and downregulation on the redox state, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and tumor growth using fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma models. TOMM20 overexpression increased OXPHOS, NADH, and NADPH with reduced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). TOMM20 induced resistance to apoptosis, including with BCL-2 and OXPHOS complex IV inhibitors, but with increased sensitivity to an OXPHOS complex I inhibitor. Also, TOMM20 induced cell growth and migration in vitro and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Conversely, knocking down TOMM20 using CRISPR-Cas9 reduced cancer aggressiveness in vivo in both chondrosarcoma and fibrosarcoma mouse models. In conclusion, TOMM20 is a driver of cancer aggressiveness by OXPHOS, apoptosis resistance, and the maintenance of a reduced state.",

Prophylactic measures, such as allopurinol, rasburicase, and hydration, are commonly initiated in these types of malignancies prior to chemotherapy to prevent TLS. However, in rare instances, TLS can still occur despite the initiation of prophylactic treatment. When TLS develops, the patient can experience various complications, such as kidney injury, muscle fatigue, paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death. Our case presents an 83-year-old male with newly diagnosed stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who developed TLS following chemotherapy despite receiving the standard prophylactic treatment of IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol.

We evaluated and compared risk of incident stroke and dementia between old and new equations of eGFR for African American and non-African American participants. Prospective observational study. Baseline values were collected from 6,814 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort between 2000 and 2002. Participants were followed up until 2018. The analytic sample consisted of 6,646 participants (mean [SD] age 62 [10] years; 53% female; 39% White, 27% African American, 12% Chinese American, and 22% Hispanic\/Latino). eGFR equation from 2021 based on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels without race. Incident stroke and dementia. Cox proportional regression adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables was performed to estimate associations between different eGFR measures and risk of incident stroke and dementia. During a median follow-up period of 17 years, 349 (5.3%) participants experienced an incident stroke event, and 574 (8.6%) participants experienced incident dementia. In the fully adjusted model, overall participants with eGFR <60 compared with those >90 mL\/min\/1.73 m Incident dementia was ascertained through International Classification of Diseases (Ninth and Tenth Revisions) codes. Our findings illustrate participants with 2021 eGFR < 60 compared with those with eGFR > 90 mL\/min\/1.73 m Existing research has established that declined kidney function is associated with stroke and dementia. Kidney function is commonly estimated using inputs of blood proteins alongside demographic inputs of age, sex at birth, and race. Inclusion of race to estimate kidney function has gained increased scrutiny given its problematic nature of being a societal construct rather than an inherent biological trait that affects function of the kidneys. Recommendations were recently made to remove race from this estimation, and data were lacking on the relationship between new estimates of kidney function with outcomes such as stroke and dementia. Our research provides updated risk estimates for stroke and dementia using the new estimation for kidney function in a large multiethnic cohort.",

This study aims to elucidate the roles of energy metabolism- and pyroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (EMAPRDEGs) in DN development. EMAPRDEGs were identified by querying the GeneCards and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Subsequent analyses included Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis. Additionally, mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-drug, and mRNA-transcription factor (TF) interaction networks were constructed. Differential expression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of EMAPRDEGs. Immune cell infiltration in DN was assessed using the ssGSEA algorithm, and the expression levels of EMAPRDEGs in DN tissues were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Thirteen EMAPRDEGs were identified, with GO and KEGG analyses indicating their involvement in energy metabolism pathways. GSEA revealed significant enrichment of these genes in biological pathways associated with diabetic nephropathy. PPI network analysis highlighted the central role of these genes within the relevant pathways. Predictive modeling demonstrated interactions between EMAPRDEGs, 69 miRNAs, and 117 TFs.

And assessing the potential intermediary effect of uric acid. The study included 8,494 participants, with 385 having gout. Four PFAS compounds (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) were measured. PFOS is the most prevalent PFAS in the environment, biota, and human tissues. It is rapidly absorbed and accumulates in the liver, kidneys, and blood, binding to serum albumin and low-density lipoprotein. PFOA is highly persistent in the body, mainly accumulating in the kidneys and liver through enterohepatic circulation, posing risks due to its difficulty in metabolism and excretion. PFHxS has the longest metabolic half-life in humans (7.3 years) and bioaccumulates in the endocrine, immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. PFNA is the second most detected PFAS in human serum after PFOS. It is more likely to accumulate and express toxicity in the reproductive organs, liver, and immune system compared to PFOS and PFOA. Multivariate logistic regression and weighted quantile sum regression were used to assess individual and mixture effects. Mediation analysis was conducted to estimate effect of uric acid. In fully adjusted model, the associations were nonsignificant, with PFOA showing a marginally positive association. Mixture analysis revealed a significant positive association with gout risk across all models. PFOS was the largest contributor to the mixture effect. Stronger associations were observed in old people and females. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. Mediation analysis indicated significant intermediary effect of uric acid in the associations of PFAS with risk of gout, with the mediated proportion ranging from 48 to 77%. This study provides evidence for a potential link between PFAS exposure and gout risk, particularly when considering mixtures. While associations with individual PFASs are largely explained by demographic and lifestyle factors, the persistent association of mixtures with gout risk highlights the importance of considering combined exposures in environmental health research. Uric acid level plays a crucial intermediary effect.",
